# CI API - Development Workflow
# =============================================================================
# This workflow was used during development on the 'api' branch.
# Now that the API has been merged to main, this workflow is kept for reference
# and will only run if the 'api' branch is recreated for future API development.
#
# For production validation (including Docker build), see: ci-full.yml
