60609,Jimmy Carter recovers from dehydration scare in Canada,"WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, appearing fully recovered from dehydration suffered while helping to build a home for charity in Canada, was released from an overnight hospital stay on Friday and addressed the project’s closing ceremony. Carter, 92, collapsed while working on Thursday at the Winnipeg construction site for Habitat for Humanity, which promotes affordable home ownership, and was taken to St. Boniface General Hospital for medical treatment and tests. By Friday morning, Carter was smiling as he returned to the building site to help kick off the project’s last day. Hours later, he and his wife, Rosalynn Carter, 89, attended closing ceremonies at the Canadian Museum for Human Rights in Manitoba’s capital, receiving a rousing ovation from the crowd. Dressed in blue jeans, a T-shirt and light-weight jacket, a relaxed, fit-looking Carter climbed a short flight of steps to the stage to salute Habitat’s members for their contributions. “I look upon all the volunteers, in a very sincere way, as human rights heroes, and I thank you for it,” he said, and joked that his “bringing attention to this Habitat project was completely unintentional.” The former first lady told the crowd her husband received a clean bill of health after an extensive battery of tests during his brief hospitalization, including from one test designed to detect heart damage. The results showed “there has never been any kind of damage at all to Jimmy Carter’s heart,” she said. “I knew he had a good heart.” Thursday’s health scare generated an outpouring of support for Carter, a Democrat who served in the White House from January 1977 to January 1981 and has lived longer after his term in office than any other president in U.S. history. A high point of his presidency was Carter’s role in brokering the 1978 Camp David Accords that ushered in peace between Israel and Egypt.  But having left office profoundly unpopular, he is widely regarded as a better former president than he was a president, and received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his humanitarian work. Carter disclosed in August 2015 that he had been diagnosed with a form of skin cancer called melanoma that had spread to his brain and elsewhere and had been spotted during liver surgery. But months later, Carter told the Maranatha Baptist Church, where he teaches Sunday school in his home town of Plains, Georgia, that his latest brain scan showed no sign of the disease. Carter was in Canada for a project to build 150 new homes for needy families, celebrating the country’s 150th independence anniversary. ",0
51565,2 Friars’ Mission: Reviving a Brooklyn Church in a Religious ‘Dead Zone’ - The New York Times,"The two Franciscan friars, complete with   robes, stood behind the bar outside the    church taking cash and slinging cans of Coors and    in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Drinks in hand, over 200 people, many wearing black chokers, macramé bikini tops and denim overall shorts, crowded into the pews on a recent Thursday night, the pop of beer cans punctuating their arrival. But they were not waiting for a sermon  —   they were waiting for Josiah Wise, who goes by the name serpentwithfeet, an RB singer whose songs have heavy gospel overtones. This was not a typical church meeting, but the San Damiano Mission is no longer a typical church. On the brink of closing the church, the Diocese of Brooklyn called in the friars, Nicholas Spano, a deacon, and the Rev. Raphael Zwolenkiewicz, who are reintroducing Catholicism to the neighborhood in unconventional ways. “We’re not here to be an invisible presence, but something very tangible,” Father Zwolenkiewicz, 65, said. “Whether it’s services in the church or out in front of the church just hanging out, or even on the corner, we’ll be in our vestments and saying hello to people as they walk by. ” On the border of Williamsburg and Greenpoint, where Sunday Mass often takes a back seat to brunch and shopping, the church had seen its membership dwindle. “That area in Brooklyn, like many other areas in the Brooklyn Diocese, is undergoing a dynamic change in demographics,” the Rev. Msgr. Joseph Grimaldi, the Brooklyn vicar for the diocese, said last month. “Williamsburg is one of the largest areas that many millennials have settled in, and a good number of them are baptized Catholics, but have not really practiced their faith. ” “With 30 people, you can’t sustain a church,” Father Grimaldi said, “but in this case we came up with a novel approach. ” The friars, members of the First Order of St. Francis, took over the former Holy Family Slovak Church on Nassau Avenue in 2015. First, they changed its name to the San Damiano Mission. Then they looked around. Masses were still being celebrated when most of the neighborhood was asleep, and the oak doors were chained and padlocked much of the time. “All of our images said, ‘We’re gone and closed,’” Mr. Spano, 35, said. They replaced the oak doors with glass ones. “There’s a lot of foot traffic here Wednesday through Sunday between 10:30 p. m. and 4 a. m.,” Mr. Spano said. “To have the church not look its best at that time doesn’t help us. ” On a good Sunday, as many as 50 people now attend Mass. It is not a huge number, “but it is a difference,” he said. St. Francis of Assisi was called upon by God to “rebuild my church for it is in ruin,” Father Zwolenkiewicz said. “So it’s the same idea that we were invited to come here and to reach out to the neighborhood and people who are here, to rejuvenate and to restore part of this community. ” Mr. Spano developed proposals to turn the church into an arts hub and a focal point for the community. The friars wear their robes in public and can often be found running errands and grabbing their morning coffee in the neighborhood. Many are surprised to see the friars, they said, and some even mistake them for actors from a nearby film and television studio. They frequently attend the concerts put on by the Lot Radio station, which operates out of a converted shipping container across the street. The groups have joined forces to raise money to restore a $226, 000 pipe organ for the church by holding shows inside the mission, like the one featuring serpentwithfeet. Sabrina Tamar, 27, has lived near the mission for 10 years. “Most people weren’t aware of this at first, but there’s definitely a sense of community I feel hasn’t been in this neighborhood in a while,” she said before taking her seat at the concert. “It’s wonderful. The friars are so tolerant and welcoming. ” Other residents agreed. “The friars know religion is a dead zone in this neighborhood, so if you want people to participate, you have to not preach,” one resident, Nikki Cohen, 30, said. She said she discovered the church through the radio station and the concert series. “This is a social place,” she said, “a community place you can come and hang out. ” For Aaron Sutula, the church beckoned. Mr. Sutula, 34, attends church only on Christmas. But he said he walked by one night and the mission was empty, but its lights were on, so he stepped inside and lit a candle. “My grandfather had just died the year before,” Mr. Sutula said. “They don’t have real candles because it’s New York City, so you just hit a button and it turns on the light. But it was nice. ” The friars have also paired with a Lutheran church to offer some services to homeless people, including making showers and barbers available every other Monday at the mission. At a recent Sunday Mass, only about 25 people were in the pews. On this particular Sunday, a party at the Lot Radio the night before had kept some parishioners home from services, Mr. Spano said. Toward the end of the Mass, Mr. Spano made several announcements, including an update on the pipe organ. They hope to have it back by Easter, he said, though once the organ is reinstalled, the fog machine used for concerts will have to go.",0

47839," Something Truly Extraordinary, And Refreshing, Happened During The CNN Democratic Debate (VIDEO)","The CNN debate between Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders took place in Flint, Michigan on Sunday   and it featured something truly extraordinary and refreshing.The candidates spent their time presenting two compelling and different visions for America, based on aspirations and hope   and conducted a battle of ideas, not playground level personal insults. It was a perfect insight into what the Republican party is currently incapable of offering the American public.While the Republican debates have featured Donald Trump raving about the size of his own penis, the amount his opponent Marco Rubio sweats, and how Ted Cruz is a liar   Bernie and Hillary kept it classy.In terms of the topics discussed, the Republican debates have so far centered around fighting against immigration, guns, equal marriage, women s reproductive rights, and each other (allowing candidates to respond to whatever personal attacks have been made that week).By contrast, the Democratic debate was wide-ranging, covering a number of social, economic and political issues.Just some of the issues covered:On all of these issues, the candidates had compelling, and different, visions for America.On Flint, both candidates came out strongly on the side of the people. Sanders saying: Over the last several weeks, I had the opportunity to meet with a number of residents of Flint, had a town meeting in Flint, and I have to tell you, what I heard and what I saw literally shattered me and it was beyond belief that children in Flint, Michigan in the United States of America in the years 2016 are being poisoned. That is clearly not what this country should be about. And Clinton adding: The governor should resign or be recalled and we should support the efforts of citizens attempting to achieve that. But that is not enough. We have to focus on what must be done to help the people of Flint. In short, they didn t fight over the matters for which there was no principle at stake. They did not call each other liars or argue their care for the people of Flint was disingenuous just to score a point.But when it came to the issues that divide Sanders from Clinton, they went at it with everything in their arsenal.For example, on money in politics. The Sanders and Clinton campaigns are markedly different. One candidate (Sanders) relying on mass micro-contributions and rejecting the influence of big money backers, and Clinton (as the establishment candidate) doing the opposite. So when the matter arose, Sanders made a simple but powerful point: One of us has a super PAC. One of us has raised $15 million from Wall Street for the super PAC. One of us has given speeches on Wall Street for hundred of thousands of dollars. Conversely, on the issue of gun control   where Clinton is in favor if stricter gun controls while Sanders is more reluctant, it was Clinton who could landed a blow   again, on the issue, not the personal attributes of the candidate.Whichever candidate more closely represents your vision for America, the debate gave you a chance to fully explore their ideas, their policies, and what they would mean for American schools, jobs, daily lives, the economy and the environment. It was a reminder that America can do grown up politics, at a time when the Republican Primary has disintegrated into a frat-house brawl.You can watch the debate in full below:  Featured image via screenshot",1
42729,#Hashtag Hell & The Fake Left," By Dady Chery and Gilbert MercierAll writers with a desire to rattle people out of their torpor occasionally wonder if it is worthwhile to continue to try to raise their voices over the din of lies and distractions.More and more for us, such thoughts are occasioned, not by the mainstream, which predictably treats all the pronouncements from the powerful as being newsworthy, but by the fake left, which lobotomizes most of whom it touches. The increasing sophistication of this group and its rate of expansion are astounding. Its purpose is to annihilate and replace the real left, and it is making great strides in this regard.The real left includes those who, like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (MLK), came to realize that quantum leaps are the way to proceed, rather than tiny incremental change. The real left does not curry favor or approval from those in power; it challenges the social status quo and respects the inherent right of an injured and indignant population to rebel against authority. It is not for rent or for sale, and it does not cave in to power. Martin Luther King March (Image Source: Wikicommons)By contrast, the motivations of the fake left are money and fame: the preservation of their place in their ivory towers, together with all the trimmings of an upper middle class or wealthy lifestyle. For them, the path is smoothed and the wheels of the machine are oiled for lucrative book deals, speaking tours, radio and television interviews, and articles that are infinitely reverberated through approved sites in the Internet. Their spokespeople channel political ideas toward electoral cycles and transform revolutionary musings into banalities, paralysis, and futile actions. They attack the public s thought process itself and engender an attention-deficit disorder. Ideas are not pursued, shared, honed, and acted upon but instead displaced by fleeting slogans like  hope and change,  or  feel the Bern. Alternatively, the ideas are muddled, branded and labeled with names like  shock doctrine,   disaster capitalism,  or  climate capitalism,  so that they may be put away and no longer examined. An important function of the fake left is to diffuse legitimate, spontaneous defense. Righteous anger is made to give way to confusion, and the impetus to revolt is transformed into the futility of virtual actions. Slogans are used as vaccines to prevent the contagion of dissent. Thoughts, not quite fully formed and the beginning of spontaneous actions, like blockage of bridges and highways, quickly dissipate. They are aborted into quick visual scans of an image or rapidly associated with a few words, like  black lives matter,  and then shared on social media. Today, Thomas Paine s Common Sense would not kindle a revolution; instead it would be quoted, posted, pinned, and tweeted. The fake left is a decoy: a hunter s trap to break the leg of any possible revolution. One of the fake left s godfathers is the multibillionaire George Soros, who obviously believes that wealth equals wisdom and has come up with a clever model to launder his vast financial gains into global political influence. Soros has developed an extremely diversified portfolio of intellectual properties and non-governmental organizations (NGO) in more than 37 countries. Artists throughout the world who present their people as victims, and promote passivity and despair, are rewarded with support and prestigious prizes. Supported organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are accused not only of selectively collecting data on human rights abuses but also of exploiting some of those data to pressure countries into policy changes that are unrelated to human rights. Independent  journalism is a major focus of Soros  Open Society Foundation, which was founded in 1993, soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union and right before the explosion of the Internet. When US-friendly corrupt governments, and US-sponsored institutions like USAID and the United Nations are exposed by the real left, Soros-sponsored think tanks and news organizations like the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) spring into action and become the voice of reason, demanding that these organizations self-reform. Countless others, also related to the Open Society Foundation, echo and amplify their message. Dismantlement and profound systemic change are never on the agenda. In most of the world, and especially the US, elections are staged, with the primary goal being to let off steam from targeted sectors of the population. A secondary goal is to make a rigged political process appear believable and give the impression of a free exchange of ideas. The candidates are presented as caricatures that trigger an emotional identification in specific groups of people. In the US in 2016, the mean, misogynist and racist ugly American stereotype is served well by Donald Trump for the right. On the other side, the reincarnated Occupy leftist champion of social justice is played by Bernie Sanders. Nonetheless it is Hillary Clinton s turn to win. Trump and Sanders serve to keep the elections in the news and to make Clinton the only supposed pragmatic choice. The ambition of Sanders to beat Hillary Clinton is questionable in light of the fact that he did not run for the presidency in 2012, although the issues were the same, and he could have benefited then from the energy of Occupy. Sander s platform is a reactivation of the Occupy themes. Occupy, however, is not what it used to be. Indeed it is a perfect example of something from the real left that was hijacked. It began as a leaderless anti-capitalist movement called US Day of Rage, but soon it acquired leaders like Chris Hedges, and its most radical elements, like the Black Bloc anarchists, were vilified and excluded. The fake left poaches the narrative of the real left so as to kill it. Outright plagiarism and abundant appropriations and rewrites are hallmarks of the fake left.  Since it lacks a heartfelt leftist rhetoric, it must continually borrow one, ironically, to excoriate it so as to present a superficial version of it. Any critical examination will show that the self-proclaimed firebrands of the left have, for decades, never moved the revolutionary dial an iota. If books like Noam Chomsky s Occupy or Naomi Klein s Shock Doctrine, or Chris Hedges and Joe Sacco s Days of Destruction, Days of Revolt had been genuine, they would have brought people to the barricades in the streets, and there would surely have been attempts to suppress them. Instead the books have been celebrated and glorified by the media establishment, because these pseudo-radical manifestos have not brought action but paralysis.The latest offering by Naomi Klein, This Changes Everything, will, by design, change absolutely nothing at all, except the balance of her bank account. TOAST OF THE LEFT: Author Naomi Klein.Those few of us who are genuinely trying to change the course of events sometimes wonder how we can compete against this powerful new machine that appropriates our message, twists it, and then blasts a degraded version of it through countless bullhorns. Doesn t the public realize that wealth and fame are not the normal trappings of revolutionaries? Don t people know that revolution is never easy, and that if it appears to be, it is not real? If words like earth, nature, life, democracy, dissent, protest, love, and revolution are allowed to lose their weight, our voices will go the way of the song of the extinct Dodo bird. It is imperative that these words be reappropriated and reinfused with meaning.Revolutionary talk cannot be permitted to become an exercise in futile venting or a validation of passivity; to mean anything at all, it must be enacted in community.Dady Chery is the author of We Have Dared to Be Free, and Gilbert Mercier is the author of The Orwellian Empire.

A day after the latest version of legislation to replace Obamacare fell victim to squabbling among Republicans who control the Senate, Trump gathered Republican senators for a lunch and told them, “We are so close.” He said Republicans had promised Americans they would repeal and replace President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law for seven years and that now is the time to act. “We have to stay here. We shouldn’t leave town,” Trump said. ",0
46977,White House: Obama May Leave the Country if Trump is Elected,"0 comments 
The White house is refusing to deny the rumors that President Obama claimed he will relocate to Canada if Donald Trump is elected as his successor in November. 
The rumor began when Canadian satire website The Burred Street Journal ran a fictional story titled “Obama Declares His Family Will Move To Canada If Trump Is Elected.” 
The story was complete with a fake statement from Obama which read, “It’s something Michelle, the kids and I have discussed as a potential solution to the Donald. I have also spoken with Prime Minister (Justin) Trudeau who outlined Canada’s generous immigration policy for wealthy individuals, so we’ll see.” 
The story was immediately picked up by American newsrooms, who ran it with headlines like “Obama Just Said He’s Moving If Trump Is Elected, Sounds Good To Us!” 
When asked about the rumors, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest would not say outright that Obama is not considering a move to Canada should the American people elect Trump. 
“He’s working very hard to make sure that nobody has to leave the country as a result of an electoral outcome that the president doesn’t support,” said Earnest, according to MRC Blog . 
While this all originated as a rumor, the White House’s decision not to categorically deny the reports had any validity only makes it appear as though Obama may actually consider moving out of the country if Trump is elected.

9712, Canada’s Foreign Minister: We Must Now Fill The Global Leadership Role U.S. Has Abandoned,"Donald Trump has done so much damage that other countries are now scrambling to figure out their new role in the world. The U.S. is quickly losing its status as a superpower with Trump at the helm and now leaders from around the globe are figuring out just who will fill the void. On Tuesday, Canada s foreign minister said that his country must step up to help fill the global leadership role that the U.S. has abandoned under Trump.During a speech, Minister Chrystia Freeland said that while the  United States has truly been the indispensable nation  in years past and  has helped foster peace and prosperity  for both Canada and the U.S., things seem to be changing.Yet it would be na ve or hypocritical to claim before this House that all Americans today agree. Indeed, many of the voters in last year s presidential election cast their ballots, animated in part by a desire to show that the burden of world leadership. To say this is not controversial: it is simply that. Canada is grateful, and will always be grateful,  to the U.S., Freeland continued. She added that Canada  will continue to seek to persuade our friend that their continued international leadership is very much in their national interest   as well as that of the rest of the free world. Yet we also recognize that the ultimately not our decision to make. It is a choice Americans must make for themselves.The fact that our friend and ally has come to question the very worth of its mantle of global leadership, puts into sharper focus the need for the rest of us to set our and we are in sovereign course. For Canada, that course must be the renewal, indeed the strengthening, of the postwar multilateral order.We will follow this path, with open hand and open heart extended to our American friend, seeking to make common cause had so often in the past.This is absolutely shameful. In less than six months Trump cost the U.S. not only its reputation but its role as a global leader as well.

30338,ZeniMax Accuses Facebook-Owned Oculus of Destroying Evidence in VR Lawsuit - Breitbart,"The latest wrinkle in the case between ZeniMax Media and Oculus over VR technology finds the plaintiff claiming destruction of evidence. [Having already accused former employee John Carmack of stealing technology designed at id Software for use at Oculus, ZeniMax now claims   Oculus participated in “intentional destruction of evidence to cover up their wrongdoing. ” In a statement provided to Ars Technica, ZeniMax said:  With the start of the trial of our case in Federal District Court in Dallas against Defendants Facebook, Oculus and its management, ZeniMax and id Software welcome the opportunity to present substantial evidence of the Defendants’ misappropriation of our Virtual Reality (VR) intellectual property. That evidence includes the theft of trade secrets and highly confidential information, including computer code. ZeniMax will also present evidence of the Defendants’ intentional destruction of evidence to cover up their wrongdoing. ZeniMax and id Software are the visionary developers of breakthrough VR technology and look forward to the vindication of our claims. Mark Zuckerberg himself will testify in the   dollar suit on January 17th, 2017. John Carmack has already done so, exactly one week prior, and Palmer Luckey will follow Zuckerberg in the coming days. Facebook’s lawyers attempted to make a case exempting Zuckerberg from direct testimony about the acquisition of Oculus, but were overruled. The newest accusations are more than likely aligned with the findings of forensic analyst Andrew S. Rosen in October 2016, when his investigation into the case led him to conclude that “statements and representations that have been sworn to and are before the court are factually inaccurate,” and further, that there were “opinions expressed in expert reports that are before the court that are demonstrably inaccurate. ” Tony Sammi, one of the lawyers representing ZeniMax Media in the suit, went so far as to dub the Oculus acquisition as “one of the biggest technology heists ever” in his opening remarks. As expected, Facebook continues to vehemently deny the charges, accusing ZeniMax of being what amounts to a very sore loser, after passing up the opportunity to invest in Oculus before it was scooped up by the social media megacorp. In a statement provided to Business Insider by an unspecified Oculus spokesperson, they claimed: Oculus and its founders have invested a wealth of time and money in VR because we believe it can fundamentally transform the way people interact and communicate. We’re disappointed that another company is using wasteful litigation to attempt to take credit for technology that it did not have the vision, expertise, or patience to build.

13072,Pourquoi les EAU financeraient la campagne du FN?,"7 845 7 5 La campagne présidentielle du Front National financée par les Émirats Arabes Unis ? L’hypothèse est moins surprenante qu’il n’y paraît. Elle pose néanmoins les questions de l’indépendance du Front vis-à-vis de son éventuel sponsor et du jeu d’influence que joueraient les EAU. 
La campagne de Marine Le Pen financée par Les Émirats Arabes Unis? C'est Médiapart qui a lancé l'info vendredi, bientôt reprise par toute la presse. Alors on peut bien sur se demander pourquoi le premier parti de France aux régionales et dans les intentions de vote à la présidentielle en est à rechercher des financements à l'étranger. On peut aussi trouver curieux qu'un parti que d'aucuns qualifient de xénophobe reçoive des fonds de pays arabes. 
Pourtant, ce rapprochement entre le Parti frontiste et les émiratis n'a rien de surprenant. © AP Photo/ Ariel Schalit Primaire de la droite: Jean-Frédéric Poisson sera-t-il exclu pour ses propos polémiques à l'occasion des « estivales de Fréjus» en septembre dernier, Wallerand de St-Just, le trésorier du Front National avait été clair au micro de France 3:
« S'il faut aller emprunter à l'étranger, nous irons emprunter à l'étranger, il n'y a aucune exclusive àça. Que ce soit en Russie en Argentine ou aux États-Unis […] Et pourquoi pas au Moyen-Orient. » 
Rappelons aussi que c'est déjà faute de trouver des banques françaises prêteuses que le FN avait emprunté 2 et 9 millions d'euros à des banques russes en 2014. D'ailleurs, le financement du FN n'est pas épargné par les péripéties juridiques. En septembre 2015, Wallerand de Saint-Just et Jean-François Jalkh, l'un des vice-présidents du parti, avaient été mis en examen pour recel d'abus de biens sociaux dans le cadre du financement de la campagne des présidentielles et des législatives de 2012, via le micro parti « Jeanne ». 
A propos du financement du FN, nous avons interrogé Gaëtan Dussausaye. Le Directeur national du Front National de la Jeunesse (FNJ) décrit une position claire et sans ambiguïté, qui ne dépend pas « des nécessités de financement » de la campagne électorale: 
« Ce financement, nous le cherchons partout. Comme les banques françaises se refusent à prêter de l'argent à un parti politique — ce qui en soit est un véritable déni de démocratie — bien évidemment, on est contraints, on est obligés, d'aller chercher des financements à l'étranger ». 
Des financements qui ne sont pas dénués d'arrière-pensées, selon Médiapart, qui mentionne une source proche de Marine Le Pen. Cette source aurait affirmé que les émiratis voulaient, en échange de leur soutien financier, que Marine le Pen évince le Qatar pour travailler avec eux si elle était élue. 
Gaëtan Dussausaye estime qu'il y a peu de chances que la candidate du FN accepte le marché: 
« Le Front National est par définition un parti patriote. Nous sommes pour la souveraineté et l'indépendance de la France. On ne va pas chercher à se défaire des liens — poreux — qui existent avec l'Arabie Saoudite et le Qatar du fait des mandats de François Hollande et Nicolas Sarkozy […] pour se remettre sous l'influence d'un autre pays étranger. » 
Evincer le Qatar à leur profit serait en tout cas cohérent pour les Émirats Arabes Unis. En effet, le Qatar et les Frères musulmans figurent au tableau des ennemis héréditaires d'Abu Dhabi. De son côté, le FN oppose volontiers les EAU au Qatar et à l'Arabie Saoudite. Ces deux pétromonarchies ont particulièrement renforcés leurs liens économiques, politiques et diplomatiques avec la France sous les mandats respectifs de Nicolas Sarkozy et de François Hollande. Du pain béni pour le Front National, qui dénonce les collusions entre ces pays et les groupes extrémistes d'engeance wahhabite qui déchirent le Moyen-Orient. © AFP 2016 BERTRAND LANGLOIS Face au FN, Robert Ménard ""Oz sa droite"" Une opposition qui lui a d'ailleurs valu des déboires avec la Justice française:
En avril 2015, le Qatar avait porté plainte pour diffamation contre Florian Philippot, vice-président du Front national. Sa faute? Avoir critiqué le Qatar et l'Arabie Saoudite « Ces pays financent l'islamisme qui tue» sur Radio Classique et LCI, au lendemain des attentats de Charlie Hebdo. La plainte n'avait finalement pas aboutie, le Parlement européen refusant de lever l'immunité parlementaire de l'eurodéputé. 
Dans ce contexte, il n'apparait donc pas étonnant que le Front National s'en tienne à la ligne que nous expose Gaëtan Dussausaye: 
« Nous avons vu, au profit de l'émergence de Daech, un certain engagement de ces pays à lutter contre ce nouveau totalitarisme du XXIème siècle. Là où des pétromonarchies telles que le Qatar ou l'Arabie Saoudite jouent un jeu trouble, de la même manière qu'un pays à la porte de l'Europe comme la Turquie de monsieur Erdogan. Donc évidemment nous préférons être en relation avec des pays qui ont des engagements dans la lutte contre Daech beaucoup plus clairs, beaucoup plus transparents. » © AFP 2016 Kirill Kudryavsev Présidentielles: rien ne peut fléchir Nicolas Sarkozy, même un scandale financier En tout état de cause, il est certain que l'Arabie saoudite, le Qatar et les EAU mènent une vraie lutte d'influence en France à coups de pétrodollars. Les EAU sont même en tête des investissements privés en provenance du Golfe en France, alors que le Qatar et l'Arabie saoudite exercent plus leur emprise dans les milieux politiques et parfois diplomatiques. Une emprise dénoncée en mars dans un dossier-choc de Marianne .
Un investissement des EAU sur le FN pourrait constituer un moyen pour eux de peser —à terme — sur la politique française. Mais au vu des chances plus que minces de Marine le Pen aux présidentielles de 2017, les EAU ne vont-ils pas se décourager? Affaire à suivre.

24096,'The only other option': Bernie Sanders backers turn to Green party's Jill Stein,"Vanessa Tijerina was not politically active until a couple years ago. Then she started looking closely at problems in the healthcare system, feeling that mainstream politicians were not delivering solutions – and discovered Bernie Sanders.

Last September, at short notice, she drove three hours to San Antonio, Texas, from her home near the border with Mexico so she could join other Sanders supporters in a protest against a Democratic congressman who had criticised the Vermont senator. In January she marched through Manhattan for Sanders, inspired by his idealistic and unorthodox message.

And then the 74-year-old lost the Democratic presidential primary to Hillary Clinton, and backed her for the White House last month at the national convention. That was where Tijerina and Sanders diverged.

“A lot of us waited with bated breath, wondering: what’s he going to do?” she said. “Because depending on what he did, that’s where the movement was either going to go or not go. He decided to stay there, and the movement can’t stay there. It cannot stay in a centrist environment. The movement is antagonising that environment so we can’t stay there.”

Tijerina and others were calling for a new phase of a Sanders-style political revolution on Thursday, as the Green party kicked off its presidential nominating convention in the improbable location of Houston, Texas – Big Oil’s back yard. (The convention’s slogan is: “Houston, We Have a Solution”.)

“To me the Green party was the only other option,” Tijerina said in a conference room at the University of Houston. “There’s just no way that anything centre or right of centre was going to get America where it needed to be.”

The 38-year-old nurse is standing as a Green party candidate for a Texas congressional district this November.

“When I found out about Jill Stein, which was literally a month after I found out about Bernie – depending on who you ask, she is perhaps more progressive than Bernie,” Tijerina said. “She is perhaps more aggressive politically than Bernie and she is perhaps, some would say, less afraid, or less intimidated – or whatever it is, she has what Bernie has and perhaps more.”

Stein is set to be confirmed as the Green party’s nominee on Saturday and is openly courting the seemingly large number of Sanders supporters who are reluctant or refusing to heed his call to support Clinton. In a Real Clear Politics average of recent polls, Stein is at 3.9%, behind the Libertarian party’s Gary Johnson, at 8%; Donald Trump is at 36.9% and Clinton at 43.5%.

Hardly numbers to threaten the duopoly, but enough to potentially complicate close races in swing states in November and indicative of significant unhappiness with the Democratic and Republican candidates. (In 2012, Johnson received only 0.99% and Stein 0.36% of the popular vote.) Enough also to awaken some deep-seated Democratic angst rooted in the trauma of 2000, when some blamed Green party candidate Ralph Nader’s presence in Florida for costing Al Gore the general election and sending George W Bush to the White House.

Adding to the sense of the Green party as an irritant for Democrats, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange may address the convention via video link on Saturday, about two weeks after carefully timed leaked emails showed that Democratic National Committee officials seemingly plotted to undermine Sanders’ campaign, causing a storm and adding to his loyalists’ antagonism towards Clinton and the party.

Stein’s choice this week of the human rights activist Ajamu Baraka as her running mate might complicate the outreach. In a blogpost last September on the left’s response (or lack of it) to Saudi Arabia’s bombing of Yemen, Baraka wrote: “Sanders supporters have not only fallen into the ideological trap of a form of narrow ‘left’ nativism, but also the white supremacist ethical contradiction that reinforces racist cynicism in which some lives are disposable for the greater good of the west.

“And as much as the ‘Sandernistas’ attempt to disarticulate Sanders ‘progressive’ domestic policies from his documented support for empire … it should be obvious that his campaign is an ideological prop – albeit from a center/left position – of the logic and interests of the capitalist-imperialist settler state.”

A request for comment made through Stein’s campaign was not returned. But it would likely take much more than some debatable blog articles to persuade many of the convention-goers in Houston to vote for an establishment figure they see as emblematic of a dishonest, warmongering status quo that is in thrall to big corporations and unwilling or unable to solve systemic inequalities.

“Voting for the oligarchy is not how you get rid of the oligarchy,” said Carlos Martinez, 40, an activist from Texas who creates social media content. “I in good conscience cannot vote for somebody that supports interventionist wars and supports what Hillary Clinton supports, and I will vote for Jill Stein.”

Sanders, some Clinton supporters – and Trump himself – have argued that casting a ballot for the Green party is tantamount to helping the Republican candidate. Stein and her supporters, of course, reject that idea.

“I really can’t tell who or what Donald Trump is,” Martinez said, “but that doesn’t mean that I’m going to be fear-baited into supporting Hillary Clinton and I don’t think that the majority of Sanders supporters are scared to vote their conscience and they’re going to be fear-mongered into pulling the lever for somebody that’s against their own interests.”

Wearing a red “Feel the Bern” T-shirt, Pam Ellis attended a boisterous evening event designed to woo the “Bernie or Bust” crowd that drew a couple of hundred people.

“I have a conflict because I like Bernie; I never really cared that much for Hillary. Nothing specific or anything, I just feel like it’s more big money influence in politics,” the 57-year-old nurse said. Her top issues were access to education and healthcare, subjects that were at the heart of Sanders’ electoral pitch – focused, like Stein’s, on social justice.

“I think he furthered the Green party platform whether he intended to or not, brought it to the forefront and caused me to do a lot of research on the Green party, and that’s why I’m here now,” she said.

Ellis also dismissed the notion that voters should think tactically. “What good is it to live in the United States where you have the right to vote and the freedom to vote for who you want to, if you’re going to be scared into voting?” she said.

“I’m tired of the lesser of the evils. I’m just sick of that. That’s not what my father and his brothers went and fought in world war two for, so we could be scared into voting for one of two candidates. This is a huge country. We should have debates with the Libertarian party and the Green party. We need to hear from everybody.”",0
55641, It’s Not Over Yet: Jill Stein Files Federal Lawsuit Over Pennsylvania Recount,"Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein has filed a lawsuit in federal court over the recount efforts in Pennsylvania. According to the complaint filed by Stein, Pennsylvania elections are a national disgrace. Voters are forced to use vulnerable, hackable, antiquated technology banned in other states, then rely on the kindness of machines,  the complaint reads.  There is no paper trail. Voting machines are electoral black sites: no one permits voters or candidates to examine them. Stein filed her lawsuit on Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The suit questions if votes in the Keystone State were counted accurately and alleged that electronic voting machines in the state had  serious cyber security problems. In the 2016 presidential election, rife with foreign interference documented by American intelligence agencies and hacks of voter rolls in multiple states, voters deserve the truth, reads the lawsuit.Stein was forced to drop her original bid for a recount in Pennsylvania on Saturday when a judge attached a $1 million price tag after Donald Trump requested a $10 million bond. Petitioners are regular citizens of ordinary means. They cannot afford to post the $1,000,000 bond required by the court,  Stein s attorney wrote in a court filing.On Sunday, Stein tweeted that she was not done yet, though.On Monday, I will escalate #Recount2016 in PA and file to demand a statewide recount on constitutional grounds. The people deserve answers.  Dr. Jill Stein (@DrJillStein) December 4, 2016Recounts in Wisconsin are already underway and early Monday morning, U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith ordered recounts in Michigan to begin at noon.Trump won all three of these battleground states by narrow margins. Despite the fact that the recounts are unlikely to change the outcome of the election, Trump has fought against them vehemently, making many people wonder what the hell he is so afraid of. Trump unleashed multiple Twitter rants railing against Stein s push for recounts, and in one of these, he managed to unwittingly make the case for the recount efforts by claiming voter fraud.

3000,U.N. rights boss urges Mexico not to enshrine army's role,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations human rights boss called on Mexico s Senate on Tuesday not to adopt a proposed law on internal security, saying it would enshrine the role of the military in law enforcement at a time when a stronger police force was needed. Zeid Ra ad al-Hussein, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said that more than a decade after the armed forces were deployed in the  war on drugs , violence had not abated and extrajudicial killings, torture and disappearances  continue to be committed by various state and non-state actors . In a statement recognizing Mexico s huge security challenge and violence sown by powerful organized crime groups, Zeid said:   Adopting a new legal framework to regulate the operations of the armed forces in internal security is not the answer. The current draft law risks weakening incentives for the civilian authorities to fully assume their law enforcement roles.  ",0
10881,"Saudi Arabia, U.S. play down reports of curbs on military support","RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia and the United States on Sunday played down media reports that Washington had decided to limit military support, including planned arms sales to the kingdom, over its war in Yemen. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said that Riyadh had not been officially informed of such decisions, which he described as contradicting the reality, while visiting U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry suggested the issue related more to a long procurement process than restrictions on military support. U.S. officials have said Washington decided to curb backing for Saudi Arabia’s campaign in Yemen, including halting the supply of some precision-guided munitions, because of concerns over widespread civilian casualties.  Yemen’s 20-month-old war has killed more than 10,000 people and triggered humanitarian crises, including chronic food shortages, in the poorest country in the Arabian peninsula. Jubeir, speaking in Arabic, told a joint news conference with Kerry: “This news that has been leaked contradicts reality. The reality is that converting regular bombs to smart bombs would be welcome because smart bombs are more accurate. “The kingdom has received nothing official from the American government in this regard,” he said in answer to a question on reported delays of U.S. weapons supplies. Kerry appeared to play down the reports of delays to weapons supplies, suggesting procurement was often a slow process, and adding he had worked hard to move sales “forward”. Kerry also said that he agreed in talks with Jubeir and other Gulf Arab foreign ministers to push for a “cessation of hostilities, which we all will work on in the next several days with hopes that within two weeks it might be possible to achieve it ...”. Saudi Arabia has been leading an Arab coalition that has been fighting against Iran-aligned Houthis who forced Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi from power nearly two years ago. The conflict has displaced some three million people, according to the United Nations.  “Our immediate priority is to end the bloodshed and that’s why reestabilishing the ceasefire is so critical,” Kerry told the news conference.  “We think we’ve found the path to move forward and invite the parties, President Hadi, the Houthis and the supporters of both sides to take advantage of this moment to try to come to the table and to try to frame an end,” he added. Saudi Arabia has been subjected to frequent cross-border raids and missile attacks by the Houthi movement. Responding to a question on whether Saudi Arabia was reconsidering its investment strategy over risks in the United States related to Donald Trump’s election and potential lawsuits under the U.S. Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, known as JASTA, Jubeir said: “The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has tremendous investments in the United States and we review those investments on a regular basis. There are issues associated with risk, but our objective is to increase those investments. We won’t decrease them.” Jubeir also said he had spent time in the United States recently to try to get to know the policies and positions of the next administration.   He also said he had dealt with Congress to press for amendments of the JASTA law, which grants an exception to the legal principle of sovereign immunity in cases of terrorism on U.S. soil, clearing the way for lawsuits seeking damages from the Saudi government.

16635,2016 campaign takes strange twists after Orlando,"Washington (CNN) The ever-turbulent 2016 election is now just plain weird.

The attack on an Orlando gay nightclub -- the worst strike on U.S. soil since 9/11 -- spurred a strange week of politics even by this year's standards.

As always, Donald Trump was at the epicenter of much of the controversy. The presumptive Republican nominee, who opposes same-sex marriage, sought to portray himself as a ""real friend"" of the LGBT community while taking ambiguous positions on gun control that he later seemed to reverse and insinuating President Barack Obama has ulterior motives in responding to terrorism.

After conceding the presidency to Trump in a phone call earlier, Clinton addresses supporters and campaign workers in New York on Wednesday, November 9. Her defeat marked a stunning end to a campaign that appeared poised to make her the first woman elected US president.

Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, broke with Obama by uttering the words ""radical Islamism"" -- rhetoric that she has long resisted for fear that it would embolden terrorists.

Terrorist attacks often have the potential to radically shift the political conversation. Trump's proposed temporary ban on Muslim immigrants in the aftermath of the San Bernardino, California, attacks, for instance, deeply resonated with GOP primary voters. But the responses this week -- in which Trump and Clinton made moves that would have been unexpected a week ago -- reflect the unusual confluence of gay rights, gun control and national security in the wake of Orlando and underscore the volatile nature of American politics this year.

No one is more unusual at the moment than Trump.

He started the week by tearing up the Terrorism 101 rule book used by most politicians who go out of their way to foster unity in the wake of such an outrage. Trump did the exact opposite.

Hours after Sunday's attack unfolded, he issued a self-congratulatory tweet that noted his long stance that radical Islam leads to terrorism. On Monday, he implied Obama was somehow complicit or sympathetic toward the U.S.-born Muslim who went on the rampage and later snatched away the campaign credentials of The Washington Post when it reported on his comments.

Trump has never been known for consistency and demonstrated his ability to hold several contradictory positions on issues that motivate the Republican base at the same time.

After the Orlando carnage, Trump suggested that if the people in the nightclub had guns themselves, the story could have been different. And he stirred his audiences with false claims that Clinton wanted to ""take away Americans' guns.""

But then, perhaps scenting a change in the political wind, Trump said he would meet with the National Rifle Association to discuss how to stop people on the terror watch list or FBI no-fly lists from buying guns, in contradiction with previous Republican positions. But during a Thursday rally in Dallas, he again seemed to take a hard line on guns, repeating his claim about Clinton and saying, ""I'm going to save your Second Amendment rights.""

Trump repeatedly claimed that he was the best friend the LGBT community has in this election -- rather than Clinton who has been deeply engaged in LGBT issues for years and counts the community as a deep well of support and donor dollars.

Clinton could not resist trolling her general election foe when CNN reporter Phil Mattingly quoted Trump on Twitter as saying: ""You tell me: who is better for the gay community and who is better for women than Donald Trump.""

The former secretary of state's campaign account tweeted back, ""Hi.""

Trump expounded further on his gun views Friday evening. At a Texas rally Trump argued, as he often has in the wake of terrorist attacks and mass shootings, that fewer gun restrictions would have lessened the death toll.

""If we had people, where the bullets were going in the opposite direction, right smack between the eyes of this maniac,"" Trump said, gesturing between his eyes. ""And this son of a b---- comes out and starts shooting and one of the people in that room happened to have (a gun) and goes boom. You know what, that would have been a beautiful, beautiful sight, folks.""

Trump also slammed President Barack Obama for arguing for action to change existing gun laws in the wake of the mass shooting in Orlando.

""President Obama is trying to make terrorism into guns and it's not guns, folks. It is not guns, folks. It is not guns, this is terrorism,"" Trump said.

But Trump was not the only politician pulling off a role reversal toward the gay community.

Iowa Rep. Steve King, who once warned his state could become a ""gay marriage Mecca"" after its Supreme Court lifted a ban on same-sex marriage, offered a striking shift in tone this week.

""I think it was clear that gays were targeted in Orlando and it does matter and it's tragic that they were targeted because of their sexual orientation,"" King told CNN's Chris Cuomo on ""New Day.""

That was a rare moment of conciliation in what was a largely divisive political week.

In fact, the manner in which the Orlando attack immediately became political fodder contrasted with the numbing wave of shock that settled over the United Kingdom, where campaigning for next week's Europe Union referendum was put on hold after the murder of lawmaker Jo Cox.

Trump and Clinton were hardly alone in the political fray this week.

With seven months left in his term, Obama could have left it to the newly minted Democratic presumptive nominee to carry the fight to Trump. But he felt a need to respond -- especially to Trump's comments.

""That's not the America we want,"" he said during an extraordinarily direct speech on Tuesday. ""It doesn't reflect our democratic ideals. It will make us less safe.""

By wading so deeply into the presidential race, Obama was offering a preview of the kind of political assist he could provide Clinton as he hits the campaign trail soon as a surrogate. But on Tuesday at least, Obama completely overshadowed his preferred successor.

The normal order is also disrupted on Capitol Hill.

Republican leaders are stuck in an uncomfortable marriage with their can't-live-with-him, can't-live-without-him presidential nominee, who is showing no signs of cooling the polarizing rhetoric that many GOP elites decry.

Lawmakers normally attracted to microphones like bees around a honey pot spent the week fleeing in the opposite direction. House Speaker Paul Ryan endured the latest round of questions about whether he would withdraw his recent endorsement of Trump.

Ryan tried to explain his dilemma in an interview that will air on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday.

""I get that this is a very strange situation. He's a very unique nominee,"" Ryan said. ""But I feel as a responsibility institutionally as the speaker of the House that I should not be leading some chasm in the middle of our party.""

Sanders is proving that piloting a soft landing to a political revolution is tough. While he vowed on Thursday to help Clinton defeat Trump, he still wants full reform of the Democratic Party and its policy platform.

Still, there are signs that Sanders is losing his leverage, not gaining it: even one of his closest backers, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, signaled on Friday that the game was up.

""I think there is a Democratic nominee at this point,"" Gabbard told CNN's Wolf Blitzer, though would not go as far as endorsing Clinton.

Arizona Sen. John McCain also felt the political heat when blasted Obama as ""directly responsible"" for the mass shooting in Orlando.

Then, like a character from a previous, more courtly political age, he had second thoughts, and issued a statement that clarified that he meant that the President's policies were to blame -- rather than the character of the man who beat him for the White House eight years ago.

A politician who admits he was wrong. In the crazed world of the 2016 presidential election circus, what could be weirder than that?",0
10032,"Skirting Kurdish issue, France says Iraq's Abadi Paris visit to boost ties","PARIS (Reuters) - France appeared to backtrack on Tuesday on efforts to mediate between Iraq s government and Kurdish regional authorities, saying a visit by Iraqi Prime Minister Haider Abadi would center on bilateral ties and fighting Islamist militants. Abadi is due in Paris on Wednesday for a two-day visit. While the invitation had been made prior to an independence vote held in Iraqi Kurdistan last month, President Emmanuel Macron s office on Friday issued a statement offering to help ease tensions between Baghdad and the Kurds. That drew a response from Abadi s office on Saturday in which Iraqi officials made clear that the invitation was not related to the Kurdish independence referendum.  President (Macron) ... recalled the importance of preserving unity and Iraq s (territorial) integrity while recognizing the rights of the Kurdish people,  the Elysee statement had said.  With the priority to fight Islamic State and the stabilization of Iraq, Iraqis must remain united.  But a statement issued on Tuesday by France s foreign ministry made no reference to the Kurdish referendum. At a briefing by Macron s office ahead of the visit, senior officials repeatedly avoided answering questions related to the Kurdish crisis, saying the visit was important to boost bilateral ties, assess the fight against Islamic State and discuss general reconciliation in Iraq.  At a time when the reconquest of territories held by Islamic State has seen considerable progress in the last few months, France wants to give the relationship with Iraq new momentum in all sectors and develop its cooperation, economic ties and political dialogue,  the foreign ministry statement said. A French diplomatic source said Paris  objective had been to try and get some form of dialogue going between the two leaders. With the Kurds being isolated by regional powers Turkey and Iran and the United States taking a tough stance on last month s vote, there was an opportunity for Paris, which has good ties with both Baghdad and Erbil, to try to act as a go-between.  The priority is to get dialogue going within the framework of the constitution,  one diplomat said. When asked on Tuesday whether France wanted to play a mediation role and had also invited Kurdish President Masoud Barzani to Paris, a French presidential source said it supported all efforts to get dialogue going and had not heard of any such invitation.  You can sense there s a certain amount of embarrassment about this,  said a second French diplomat. ",0

70547,Trump visit to Britain still unfixed nine months after PM May's invitation: sources,"LONDON (Reuters) - Nine months after Prime Minister Theresa May invited President Donald Trump for a formal state visit to Britain, no arrangements have yet been made and there is no sign of the visit taking place soon, U.S. and British officials said. Discussions between Washington and London about a Trump visit have continued, said one official who asked not to be named, but so far the White House has not signaled when and how the president wants to proceed. May s invitation to Trump during a visit to Washington a few days after he took office sparked controversy in Britain. Just hours after she left the White House, Trump announced his widely-criticized ban on travel from Muslim-majority countries. Such is the controversy that some officials on both sides of the Atlantic are privately having second thoughts about the visit, worried about street demonstrations that might greet Trump in London and other British cities.  There have been signs of relief in some quarters that he has yet to appear on Her Majesty s schedule,  said a British official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Given Trump s penchant for showmanship and his pre-presidential visits to the two golf courses he owns in Scotland, many Trump-watchers expected Britain to be one of the first stops on any presidential European tour. White House representatives told British officials at the time of the invite that Trump had accepted. But a senior U.S. government official told Reuters in July that Trump had no plans to visit Britain in the near future. A full-scale state visit to Britain involves considerable pomp. Upon arriving in London, the president would be greeted by Queen Elizabeth and other members of the Royal Family at a ceremony near the Houses of Parliament.  Some British opponents of Trump including former Labour Party leader Ed Miliband have promised to organize protests should he visit.  We remain in the same position with the Trump visit   The queen extended an invitation to President Trump to visit the UK, it was accepted, and there is no change to those plans. But a date has not been set,  a spokesman for the British Embassy in Washington said.  We re looking forward to welcoming President Trump to the UK,  the spokesman added. U.S. officials, including Trump aides and spokespeople and representatives of the U.S. Embassy in London, did not respond to detailed emails requesting comment. ",0

47035,3 Mineral Waters That Can Remove Aluminum from the Brain,"by PAUL FASSA report this ad 
There has been a dramatic increase in neurological diseases linked to aluminum toxicity . The blood brain barrier doesn’t stop aluminum’s intrusion into our gray matter. Aluminum accumulates and remains in tissue that doesn’t have a rapid cellular turnover. report this ad 
Apoptosis is the natural cell death and replacement process that occurs throughout the body, excluding cancer cells. Cancer cells keep reproducing and colonizing into tumors unless apoptosis is introduced or the cells are outright killed from chemical compounds, both natural and synthetic. 
Aluminum accrues to toxic levels over time in slow apoptotic cell turnover tissues, such as bone matter, the heart and the brain. The brain and its associated nervous system is where diseases such as Alzheimer’s , Parkinson’s, MS, chronic fatigue and other neurological or auto-immune diseases manifest, including the complete autistic spectrum, from learning disorders to full blown autism. 
There is no shortage of aluminum toxins in our environment. It’s in cookware, beverage containers, foil, cigarette smoke, cosmetics, antiperspirants, sunscreen, antacids, and those ubiquitous chemtrails that most ignore from which aluminum nanoparticles can be breathed into our lungs and routed directly into our blood or through the sinuses into our brains. 
Aluminum is in all vaccines. Injecting aluminum bypasses the possibility of eliminating it through normal channels. Straight into the blood it goes to be carried into the brain and heart, adding to their accumulated aluminum toxicity loads. report this ad 
According to Dr. Chris Exley, PhD, we have come into the aluminum age. Many trolling commentators love to explain how aluminum is the must common mineral on the planet and therefore it’s harmless. Dr. Exley has dedicated over two decades of his scientific life to researching aluminum toxicity. He calls the period of time from the early 20th Century to now the “Age of Aluminum.” 
Before then, aluminum remained in the ground as the most abundant mineral in earth that hadn’t yet been mined. Dr. Exley claims mining aluminum and using it in so many ways corresponds to the marked increase of neurological diseases. 

Dr. Chris Exley’s Message to the 2011 Vaccine Safety Conference 
A key aspect of his conference delivery concerned helping vaccinated kids improve their neurological damage. Ironically, it involves the second most abundant mineral in mother earth – silica. Exley has put kids who had autism spectrum disorders or other neurological damage from vaccinations on a form of silica known as silicic acid with excellent results. 
Silicic acid is basically oxygenated silica. Exley considers this the best and most bio-available way to get silica through the gut and into the blood, then into brain matter where it binds with the aluminum molecules and leads them out of brain cell tissue safely through the urine. 
He had used a Malasysian mineral water called Spritzer on aluminum toxic children suffering from autism spectrum disorders with significant success. Aluminum is in almost all vaccines. Later he and his team had 15 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients use that water at the same rate of one liter per day for 13 weeks. 
Aluminum levels were lower by anywhere from 50 to 70 percent in all the subjects involved, and of the 15 AD patients, eight no longer deteriorated and three actually showed substantial cognitive increase. Perhaps coconut oil is better for reversing AD, but mineral waters high in Orthosilicic or ionic silicic acid will reduce aluminum toxicity in the brain to help ward off AD. 
The more USA accessible mineral waters with similar levels of silicic acid to Spritzer, which can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, are Volvic and Fiji. My personal favorite is Fiji because it has the highest level of ionic suspended silica as silicic acid and is the least expensive. I’ve seen it in WalMart at $1.99 per liter. 
Also, People’s Chemist Shane Ellison analyzed various water bottles and said Fiji water bottles are free of BPA and “its chemical cousins”. Others he rates highly as BPA free are Voss, Evian, and Smart Water. 
The suggested protocol is at least five days consuming a 1.5 liter bottle of water daily. More is required for high levels of aluminum toxicity. Dr. Exley considers drinking the whole bottle within an hour as the most efficient method of detoxing aluminum from the brain. 
Dr. Exley explains that there are three commercial bottled waters listing silica amounts as milligrams (mg) per liter on the bottle. Fiji has the highest amount of the three. Neither of us is affiliated with Fiji. 
Silica mineral waters can be supplemented to help prevent dementia. Obviously it can also be used as an adjunct with pure cold pressed coconut oil to stop early onset Alzheimer’s or even reverse most of the symptoms after AD symptoms appear. More on coconut oil for Alzheimer’s can be found here . 
Aluminum (Al) is passed out through the urine when one supplements silica sufficiently. It seems there’s little danger of taking too much, as long as adequate water is consumed and vitamin B1 and potassium levels are maintained. 

More About Silica 
Silica helps ensure collagen elasticity of all connecting tissues in the body, including tendons and cartilage. This reduces aches and pains and maintains your body’s flexibility. It has also been determined that high levels of blood serum silica keep arterial plaque from building and clogging blood vessels. 
A major culprit for arterial plaque has recently shifted from cholesterol buildup to arterial calcification from serum calcium that is not absorbed as bone matter. It’s known that silica is an important part of building bone matter. 
Without sufficient silica, magnesium, and vitamin K2, calcium doesn’t become part of bone matter and remains in the blood to potentially calcify in the soft tissue of inner artery walls and the heart. 
Silica is vital for keeping strong bones and a healthy cardiovascular system. This qualifies silica as an essential anti-aging mineral that is much more than a skin deep beauty mineral. Other good sources of silica are the herb horsetail, cucumbers, and diatomaceous earth powder. 
Although these three other sources are helpful for the recent aforementioned reasons, they lack the ionic suspension of silicic acid found in the mineral waters to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. I just found these other sources for ionic silica or silicic acid as well, here and here .

5246,SB Nation Claims New England Patriots Have a ’Trump Problem’ - Breitbart,"New England Patriots Quarterback Tom Brady, Head Coach Bill Belichick, and principle owner Robert Kraft, according to SB Nation staff writer Charlotte Wilder, by supporting New York billionaire Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, somehow leave their fans struggling with “emotional implications” making it hard for them to watch the games and enjoy the team’s march to a potential fifth Super Bowl victory. [Without citing any hard evidence that the team won’t be supported —  like organized protests or decline in ticket sales —  Wilder instead provides some anecdotal stories about some liberal friends not being able to enjoy the games because they were upset with Trump’s message. She also says Brady’s facebook page was inundated by negative remarks from alleged fans.   But Wilder doesn’t really make a very good case that the fans will be bailing on Tommy and the boys. Significantly, she fails to point out that Boston Red Sox fans didn’t have any problems supporting conservative pitcher Curt Schilling when their team, which sits in the hub of New England’s liberal leaning swath of America, helped upend the   curse of the Bambino by sweeping the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2004 World Series. Now Wilder contends that although Pats fans never lost faith and were able to endure   and   “recently, that blind faith has faced its greatest test in the form of the team’s connection to Republican   Donald Trump. ” Wilder, who hails from Lincoln Mass where 77. 7 % of the population voted for the failed   ticket, argues, “The trouble began when Patriots reporters spotted Brady with a Make America Great Again hat in his locker in Foxboro in the fall of 2015. ” Wilder points out that the New England legend donned the hat “soon after Trump announced his candidacy and called Mexicans rapists in the same speech. ” Wilder’s bias intentionally mischaracterizes Trump’s comment. As Breitbart News reported in June, Trump was not referring to all Mexicans as Wilder implies but “was referring to illegal aliens coming over the U. S.  border who commit additional crimes, such as rape. ”  Wilder demonstrates that she’s the one with the Trump problem when she calls the    “one of the most divisive and   figures in the history of American politics.’  When Brady said back in 2015 that it would be “great” if his “friend” Trump won the election, and Trump responded by saying “Tom Brady is a great friend of mine. He’s a winner and he likes winners,” Wilder claims that shock permeated the internet. Brady never went on record saying who he actually voted for. The SB Nation writer goes on to characterize the man who will be President of the United States on January 20th as one who ran “with the most   (and racist, misogynistic,   Islamaphobic, etc.) rhetoric. ”  To support her case that the Patriots have a “Trump Problem,” the author cites a story that her mom told her about one of her friends, who once was a   fan but can no longer watch Pats games. Wilder’s mom said, “She used to watch every Sunday with her family, and now she just can’t do it. ” Wilder called the friend soon after she was told the story and asked her if she can no longer support the team. “Yeah, I just will not watch,” Susan Pease said:  I really enjoy watching the game with my family. I like what it means for my family to sit down and talk and laugh and watch and snack and now   …     I just, it’s just ruined for me. It’s not the worst thing about this, of course  —   this whole thing stems from my tremendous disappointment over this election and country. But it will forever color my opinion of the team. I will not watch, I will not buy any more jerseys. I’m done. But Pease is not alone,  Wilders claims “at least 6” other people she knows can’t watch the games either. I’m sure that will make a big dent in the ratings for the playoff game at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, where the Patriots will host the Houston Texans in the NFL Divisional Round on Saturday. ",0

26910,Death Toll From Brazil Prison Riot Reaches 26 Decapitations Are Seen - The New York Times,"RIO DE JANEIRO  —   The death toll from a riot in a penitentiary in northeastern Brazil rose on Sunday to 26 prisoners, increasing the number of prison killings in the country this year to more than 120. Decapitations and mutilations are common in Brazil’s violent, overcrowded prisons, in which 40 percent of inmates have yet to be sentenced, but the latest wave of brutality has appalled many here. The riot began around 5 p. m. on Saturday at the State Penitentiary of Alcaçuz, 13 miles from Natal, in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, and continued until around 7 a. m. on Sunday, when riot police officers took control of the prison. “The situation of the rebellion is controlled,” said Maj. Eduardo Franco of the Rio Grande do Norte police. On Sunday, the authorities initially said they had found 27 bodies, but the death toll was later revised to 26 Major Franco said there had been a mistake. Many of the bodies were mutilated. The prison has a capacity of 620 but was holding around 1, 100 prisoners when the riot began, the authorities said. All of the inmates had been sentenced, Major Franco added. Wilma Batista, the director of the prison agents’ union in Rio Grande do Norte, sent a photograph of two headless, mutilated corpses in a prison yard via a cellphone messaging service and said she had seen many others. “We are shocked,” she said. With Brazil swamped in recession, President Michel Temer’s government reeling from one graft scandal after another, and a wave of seemingly uncontrollable prison violence, many Brazilians feel they are going back to a darker recent past when crime, corruption and the economy were out of control. “We thought we had turned that page, and now it is coming back,” said Mauricio Santoro, a professor of international relations and political science at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. The killings reflected the escalation of a deadly gang war that exploded when 56 prisoners were massacred in Manaus, in Amazonas State, on Jan. 1. Four more were killed the next day in another jail in the city. The state authorities attributed the Manaus deaths to the Family of the North, an Amazon drug gang that had attacked prisoners connected to a rival gang, the São   First Capital Command, known by its Portuguese abbreviation, P. C. C. The gangs were believed to be fighting for control of lucrative drug smuggling routes. The P. C. C. was for years allied with a Rio de Janeiro drug gang called the Red Command. Last year, the alliance fell apart, leading to a spate of prison killings. On Jan. 6, after the Manaus massacre, 33 prisoners were found butchered at a prison in Boa Vista in Roraima State, in the far north of Brazil. The state authorities said the P. C. C. was behind the killings. Four more prisoners were killed in a third Manaus prison after being moved from the site of the first massacre. The riot on Saturday night began when prisoners linked to the P. C. C. rebelled during visiting hours, Ms. Batista said. They were in a separate prison, Rogério Coutinho Madruga, which is next to Alcaçuz and effectively part of the same complex. She said that just six prison agents were on duty, and that they managed to free visitors before retreating to another block. “The agents saved the visitors and had to retreat” because prisoners set the block on fire, Ms. Batista said. The escaped prisoners then attacked a block inside the Alcaçuz jail that housed men from another gang, the Rio Grande do   Crime Syndicate, Ms. Batista said. Since 2015, many of the cells inside Alcaçuz have had no bars, and prisoners wander freely 24 hours a day, Ms. Batista said. Police officers and prison guards managed to stop the killing from spreading further, but electricity to the prison was cut. The police decided to wait until dawn before entering, and they restrained desperate relatives who were trying to get inside. Lincoln Gakiya, a state prosecutor from an organized crime unit in São Paulo State who has specialized in the P. C. C. said its split with the Red Command was behind the crisis. The Rio gang has allied with five other gangs around Brazil, including the Crime Syndicate. “This war is for the hegemony of the drug trade,” Mr. Gakiya said. “The prison system is not prepared for this gang war. There is no place to separate the gangs. The system is overcrowded, so the tendency is to get worse. ” A cellphone video circulating on social media showed a man with his face covered, brandishing what looked like a machete or a sword, walking among a large number of mutilated bodies in what appeared to be a prison yard. The letters P. C. C. were scrawled in what looked like blood on a wall. Although it was impossible to verify the video, the bodies visible were wearing blue shorts similar to those worn by prisoners shown in local news reports. Grisly videos like this have circulated after all of the attacks. Sublieutenant Eliabe Marques, a police officer and the president of a Rio Grande do Norte state association of police and firefighter sublieutenants, said the dispute between the P. C. C. and the Crime Syndicate had grown worse recently. “In jail, the prisoner has to join one or other of the gangs, P. C. C. or the Crime Syndicate,” he said. “It is a phenomenon that is making the situation in Rio Grande do Norte even more serious. ” Ms. Batista said the prison agents’ union had warned of potentially explosive conditions inside the prison but had been ignored. “It is very sad, not just for the butchery, but to see organized crime face the state, the power of the state, leaving more scars on prison agents who suffer psychologically and physically from such a stressful profession,” she said.",0
21669,Philippine police chief defends deadly drug war of the 'Davao Boys',"MANILA (Reuters) - The police chief of the Philippines on Wednesday stood by the head of a secretive unit behind dozens of killings in the country s war on drugs, saying officers fired only in self-defence and the death toll reflected the danger and the scale of the narcotics problem. National police chief Ronald dela Rosa was responding to a Reuters Special Report that spent four months examining killings by one group of policemen from or near Davao City, the hometown of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Dela Rosa said police district 6 in Quezon City had Metro Manila s most serious drug problem and he personally sent squad commander Lito Patay there because he was a  very professional  and  very dedicated  officer capable of dealing with it. Patay handpicked and headed a unit of 10 men who called themselves the  Davao Boys , which racked up the highest number of kills in Quezon City, a violent frontline in Duterte s ferocious anti-narcotics campaign.  Police station 6 officers killed 108 people in anti-drug operations from July 2016 through June 2017, the campaign s first year, accounting for 39 percent of Quezon City s body count, according to official crime reports analyzed by Reuters. A majority of the killings were carried out by the squad run by Patay, who was reassigned to Quezon City just a few weeks after Duterte unleashed his crackdown.  He (Patay) was chosen because I have big trust in him, he has the balls to face the problems. He will fight,  dela Rosa told reporters.  He is not an officer who is after money, who will be assigned in an area only to collect money, he is not that kind of officer. He has focus. I assigned him there because I know he can deliver.  Asked about the high rate of killings in areas under Patay, he said deaths were inevitable where the drugs trade was rampant.  So what s the problem? The worst drug problem is there in station 6, so if you hit the problem head on, you face the problem head on then, there would always result in casualties,  he said.     Nearly 4,000 mostly urban poor Filipinos have been killed in anti-drug operations since July 2016. Police reject activists  allegations they have executed drug users and peddlers and say they kill only when their lives are in danger. Dela Rosa said Patay has since been reassigned to another province to make him eligible for promotion, reflecting his success in convincing drug suspects in Quezon City to surrender to the authorities.  He said Patay had been  given a free hand  at station 6 and had command responsibility over his operations.   It is his own call whatever he does there, he has to solve the drug problem,  dela Rosa said. The story of the Davao Boys also highlights a larger dynamic: Many of the drug war s key police officers - dela Rosa included - hail from or served in Duterte s hometown, where the campaign s brutal methods originated during his time as mayor. Duterte has repeatedly denied he ordered the killings of criminals and drug dealers during his 22 years as Davao mayor, or his 17 months as president. Dela Rosa appeared frustrated when asked by a reporter if he personally had ordered the deaths of drug suspects in Quezon City. He said Patay s men had no alternative but to kill armed criminals who refused to go quietly.  He was placed there to address the drug problem, and not to kill those who deserved to be killed,  he said of Patay.  If they resist, why would you risk your life? You have to fight back.       ",0
27638,Will the Polar Vortex Return This Winter? - Russia News Now,"This post was originally published on this site By Jeremiah Johnson Ready Nutrition November 3, 2016 
ReadyNutrition Guys and Gals, “Old Man Winter” is starting to rear his ugly head. Yeah, so what? So there is a difference this year on three fronts. The first has to do with the weather itself, and the second is the situation in the U.S. and the world. Throughout history winter has been (at times) so severe as to cause large numbers of deaths and great hardships. Throughout history warfare has been conducted during the winter months after the harvest has been taken in. Between you and I, the harvest is being taken in, and the whole world has been on the brink of war for quite some time. The third front: in the U.S., with the election. 
Weather, War, and Domestic Issues Could be a Recipe for Disaster 
Let’s address the weather portion first. Think Progress posted an article on the polar vortex shift that will affect our winter considerably. The polar vortex is usually “confined” to an area around the North Pole. It is a gigantic, constantly-moving system of air that is circulating and swirling. As the site mentioned, the last polar vortex shift affected more than 200 million people in 2014. I can attest to the fact that I was one of them: in January of 2014, it was -26 Fahrenheit outside of my cabin, and never rose above -10 Fahrenheit for almost the entire month. 
From the perspective of a global war, the Ukrainian-Russian situation is intensifying with the Ukrainian Army moving troops and equipment into Eastern Ukraine for operations against the separatists. As we speak, a Russian fleet is sailing toward Syria. The fighting in Syria between Assad’s forces and the Russian army and the Islamic terrorists is burning fiercely. The U.S. and Russia are facing off toward a nuclear war. North Korea continues to test missiles and threatens an EMP (Electromagnetic Pulse) and/or nuclear attack on the U.S. about once a week. 
That “third front” of the domestic situation in the U.S…. believe it or not, here is the highest potential for something bad to occur. Such is because Obama will think nothing of enacting Martial Law with either the advent of civil unrest and rioting, and/or a nuclear war. The volatility and unpredictability of the situation can be the undoing of the entire country. ",1
59941,"Keystone XL builders can use non-U.S. steel, White House says now","(Reuters) - The Keystone XL oil pipeline does not need to be made from U.S. steel, despite an executive order by President Donald Trump days after he took office requiring domestic steel in new pipelines, the White House said on Friday.  “It’s specific to new pipelines or those that are being repaired,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters on Air Force One, when asked about a report by Politico that Keystone would not need to use U.S. steel, despite Trump’s order issued on Jan. 24. “Since this one is already currently under construction, the steel is already literally sitting there, it’s hard to go back. Everything moving forward would fall under that executive order,” Sanders said. The southern leg of Keystone is completed and started pumping oil in 2013. Some pipe segments that could be used for Keystone XL, which would bring oil from Alberta, Canada to Nebraska, have already been built. Former Democratic president Barack Obama rejected TranCanada Corp’s (TRP.TO) multibillion-dollar pipeline, saying it would not benefit U.S. drivers and would contribute emissions linked to global warming.  Trump’s order expedited the path forward for TransCanada to reapply to build Keystone XL.  In weeks after issuing the order, Trump said in speeches and in meetings, including one with manufacturing CEOs, that Keystone would be required to use U.S. steel. In a speech this week to a joint session of Congress, Trump softened that stance saying new pipelines would have to be made with it. Economists told Reuters days after Trump issued the order that the steel requirement had many loopholes, would not be easily enforceable, and could violate international trade law. Even if there were no loopholes, U.S. steelmakers would receive negligible benefit from Keystone XL, because they have limited ability to meet the stringent requirements for the project. The office of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said it welcomes the allowance of non-U.S. steel, calling it a “recognition that the integrated Canadian and U.S. steel industries are mutually beneficial.”  TransCanada said it was encouraged by the White House statement on non-U.S. steel and that its presidential permit application on Keystone was making its way through the approval process.  Canadian Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said on Twitter that allowing non-U.S. steel was “important for companies like Evraz Steel,” a local subsidiary of Russia’s Evraz PLC, which had signed on to provide 24 percent of the steel before Keystone XL’s rejection by Obama.

3026,A War of Brothers in Iraq: ‘I Will Kill Him With My Own Hands’ - The New York Times,"FALLUJA, Iraq  —   In the days leading up to the storming of Falluja by Iraqi forces, Brig. Gen. Hadi Razaij, the leading Sunni police commander in the campaign, sat on a cot in an abandoned house near the front line. He described the resistance that lay ahead: a determined force of hundreds of jihadists that had months to prepare. General Razaij’s presence on the battlefield shows that local Sunnis, and not just the Shiite forces that now dominate Iraqi politics, are fighting to liberate their own communities, and has helped tamp down fears that the battle for Falluja would heighten sectarian tensions. He was dispassionate as he described the challenges, but for him the fight was personal, too. General Razaij’s brother stands accused of being a member of the Islamic State and is in a prison cell after being arrested at a checkpoint with a car full of explosives. In northern Iraq, Nofal Hammadi, the    of Mosul, is working with the United States to plan for that city’s liberation from the Islamic State. He, too, has family in the fight: Mr. Hammadi’s brother is an Islamic State official, having appeared in a video pledging his allegiance to the terror group and disowning his brother. Even as the central question of Iraq remains unanswered  —   whether the country’s Sunni minority and Shiite majority can ever peacefully coexist in a unified state  —   the experiences of General Razaij, Mr. Hammadi and others add a troubling corollary: It is not clear that Iraq’s divided Sunnis will ever be able to find peace among themselves after a conflict that in many ways is playing out as a war within families. After all, when Iraqi Sunnis talk about fighting the Islamic State, it is not a discussion of some shadowy and unknowable force. It is about sons and brothers, nephews and neighbors. “Today we don’t necessarily need reconciliation between Sunnis and Shiites,” General Razaij said. “We need reconciliation among one sect. ” (General Razaij has given conflicting statements about his jailed brother, telling the local news media that he had disowned him. But in an interview with The New York Times, he said he believed his brother was innocent.) General Razaij was asked how many of his men were fighting against brothers or other close relatives who had joined the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. “It’s so many,” he said. One of General Razaij’s men, Salih Ibrahim Sharmoot, is a policeman from Falluja who has been fighting along the city’s southern edge  —   a battle in which government forces made quick and surprising gains on Friday, capturing the main government compound. He said his brother Muwafaq joined ISIS in 2013. Antigovernment fervor was running strong in Falluja, in opposition to the sectarian policies of Nuri Kamal   the prime minister at the time, who had ordered the mass arrests of Sunni men on often unsubstantiated terrorism charges. “If I catch him during the battles, I will kill him with my own hands because he is a criminal,” Mr. Sharmoot said about his brother. For Iraq ever to be at peace with itself after the end of the Islamic State, it will require reconciliation on a number of levels, especially within the Sunni community. That minority fell from power after the United   invasion in 2003 and has witnessed its own decimation, with millions of its followers now displaced from their homes as fighting between government forces and ISIS rages across   areas. The last time this happened, in 2006 and 2007, it took American money and influence to pacify Sunni areas then in the grip of Al Qaeda in Iraq, the forerunner of the Islamic State. With the   Sunni Awakening, former insurgents were paid to switch sides and ally with the government. That required a measure of reconciliation, if not forgiveness, within the Sunni community. This time, most everyone agrees, will be different. Without the United States as a mediator, or its money to buy loyalty,   and revenge are likely to rule the day. “Never,” General Razaij said when asked if peaceful reconciliation was possible among Sunnis. “For those who slaughtered Iraqis, it’s a crime for them to live. ” Iraq’s Shiites seem to recognize this, and have been keen to essentially outsource the business of determining who is or is not an Islamic State collaborator or sympathizer. When government forces liberate a village from ISIS, they often turn to local Sunnis to determine who should be arrested, according to interviews with officials and Sunni residents. And when allegations of militia abuses surfaced recently, including the torture and executions of men fleeing the fighting around Falluja, a prominent group of   Sunnis came to the defense of the government, emphasizing the importance of taking a hard line. In a televised news conference, Abu Azam   a leader of Sunni tribal fighters in Anbar Province, which includes Falluja, stressed the tribal traditions of Iraq. He said he would not “forget or forgive the killers from ISIS. ” More than a dozen recent interviews, with Sunnis from areas where the Islamic State has had a presence, revealed the extent to which the terror organization has divided families. In many cases, they described a familiar pattern of radicalization for their relatives  —   beginning not with any special interest in religion, but rather the 2003 invasion and the Sunni insurgency that followed. Many spent time in   prisons in Iraq, where they studied the Quran and plotted jihad. In 2013, when Mr. Maliki’s policies sparked nationwide Sunni protests, there was a ready constituency of aggrieved and radicalized Sunnis the Islamic State could exploit. Alaa   a Sunni from Salahuddin Province who has joined a   militia, said that his uncle, a member of the Islamic State, was not religious before he spent time in an American prison in Iraq. “He used to not even pray or fast, and did not like religious subjects,” Mr. Jibouri said. In Diyala Province, a farmer who asked to be identified as Abu Anas said his younger brother, Hatim, was swayed in 2014 by politicians and clerics calling for an end to the unjust treatment of Sunnis carried out by the   government. “The Sunni youth, among them my brother, were caught up in the swirl of sectarian tensions,” he said. At the time, Mr. Anas said, the movement felt like a tribal revolution against oppression, but was quickly subsumed by the Islamic State. “I never would have imagined my simple, naïve,   brother would turn into a human monster,” he said. “He used to be afraid of even slaughtering a chicken, and would make excuses not to do so. ” Mr. Anas joined with government forces to fight the Islamic State, carrying a Kalashnikov rifle that had been in his family for almost two decades. He said he later had received a text message from his brother: “You chose the path of hell, and I chose the path of heaven. ” The Islamic State recently released a video from Mosul that purported to show a fighter executing his older brother, described in the video as a government spy. As the bearded ISIS fighter stood over his kneeling brother, who was dressed in an orange jumpsuit, he addressed his family and tribe and said he was acting in their name to “purify” the shame his brother brought to them. Then he shot him in the head. Thousands of Sunni tribal fighters and local policemen, partly motivated by revenge for the devastation the Islamic State has brought to their communities, have joined government security forces and Shiite militia groups in the fight for Falluja, the third major battle for that city since 2003. “This is the last time we are going to go into Falluja,” said Mouwafak   a prominent Shiite politician and Iraq’s former national security adviser, who has predicted a bloody   battle after the city was liberated. “There is not going to be any appeasement. The Sunnis who liberate Falluja are going to govern Falluja. ” He said that those men were more attuned to the traditional tribal rhythms of life in Anbar, and that their loyalty to Baghdad could be bought. “The tribal fighters don’t even know how to pray,” he said. “They like their booze and they enjoy life. They are motivated by two things: money and power. ”",0
6370,Obama administration paves way for Iran to rebuild its air force with US-made aircraft,"BY ROBERT SPENCER 
“Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.” 
How is this not treason? 
“Iran to Add U.S.-Made Aircraft to Its War Fleet: Obama admin paves way for Tehran to rebuild its air force,” by Adam Kredo, Washington Free Beacon , October 24, 2016: 
The Obama administration is forging a pathway for Iran to purchase American-made airliners that are likely to be converted for use in the Islamic Republic’s military, drawing concerns on Capitol Hill amid a flurry of recent attacks by Iranian-backed forces on U.S. military assets in the Middle East, according to conversations with lawmakers and fleet information obtained by the Washington Free Beacon . 
Iran recently announced that it had struck deals with the U.S. Boeing airline manufacturer and France’s AirBus that would permit the companies to transfer technology and provide training to help the Islamic Republic produce equipment that would strengthen its aging fleet of American-made planes. 
Iran currently uses at least six Boeing aircraft as part of its air force fleet. These planes were put on display last week when Iran launched a series of war drills aimed at deterring Western attacks. 
As Iran angles to purchase 80 new jets from Boeing, which has lobbied heavily in favor of these sales, the Obama administration is being accused of helping to pave the way for Iran to transfer these commercial liners for use in its war fleet, according to lawmakers and sources familiar with Iran’s military buildup. 
Iran has a history of transferring commercial jets purchased from America to its air force for use in military operations and the transfer of weapons and other illicit material abroad. 
Lawmakers worry that the White House’s efforts to facilitate new airliner sales to Iran Air, the country’s national airline, will help Tehran bolster its war fleet at a time when it is threatening military action

19994,Many Women Suffer From Fungal Infections And They Can Cure Them At Home,"posted by Eddie Female fungal infections have become quite common in recent times. Treating them is difficult, but luckily, we have a few natural solutions which will help you treat them from the comfort of your own home. Tea Rosemary tea is particularly effective against the symptoms of fungal infections. The tea can also be used for daily intimate care. To treat yeast infections, drink 1-4 cups of rosemary tea a day, and in cases of fungal infections, you should drink blueberry juice a couple of times a day. You can also eat fresh blueberries or take cranberry extract for the same problem. Oils Some essential oils have powerful antifungal properties that can relieve infections. You can soak a tampon in tea tree oil and insert it into your vagina to treat vaginal infections. Leave the tampon in for a couple of hours and repeat the process twice a day for best results. Oregano oil provides a similar effect, and can be applied topically diluted with olive oil. Taking two capsules of oregano oil extract every day and you will defeat the infection in just a week or two. Garlic Garlic is great against yeast infections. We recommend applying a garlic paste on the affected area, or consuming a mixture made of garlic, oil, vitamin E capsules and coconut oil. Vinegar Pour a cup of apple cider vinegar in a tub of hot water, then soak in it for 20 minutes to relieve fungal and yeast infections. Marigold Marigold has great antifungal and anti-inflammatory properties. Take a couple of marigold leaves, then mash them and apply the paste on the affected area to get rid of the infection. The treatment should be avoided during pregnancy. source:",1

30853,Earth Isn’t Doomed Yet. The Climate Could Survive Trump Policies. - The New York Times,"Is the battle to contain global warming now lost? With the election of Donald Trump, it certainly looked that way to many of the shellshocked diplomats gathered in Morocco earlier this month at the first climate summit following the breakthrough agreement in Paris last year to contain greenhouse gas emissions. During the campaign, the   of the world’s second largest polluter claimed that climate change is a hoax, threatened to drop the Paris accord, committed to kill the Clean Power Plan at the center of President Obama’s emissions reduction strategy, and promised a new dawn for the fossil fuel industry. Don’t give up just yet. True, international diplomacy will become more difficult as China and India weigh their own energy policy commitments in the light of the possibility that the United States will walk away from its promises. But President Trump’s climate policy  —   or his lack of one  —   could work out in surprising ways. Ted Nordhaus and Jessica Lovering, in a report published on Tuesday by the Breakthrough Institute, pointed out that real progress on reducing carbon in the atmosphere has been driven so far by specific domestic energy, industrial and innovation policies, “not emissions targets and timetables or international agreements intended to legally constrain national emissions. ” It’s certainly possible that a Trump administration will drop the Clean Power Plan and renege on the Paris accord. But as long as it keeps the nation’s nuclear power plants online, continues tax incentives for wind and solar energy and stays out of the way of the shale energy revolution, Ms. Lovering and Mr. Nordhaus write, “the U. S. might outperform the commitments that the Obama administration made in Paris. ” For all his promises to bring back coal jobs in Appalachia, Mr. Trump might be drawn in a different direction by his own objectives of promoting natural gas and achieving energy independence. If he gives those goals high priority, he could well end up pursuing policies that would ultimately lower carbon emissions. Striking a meaningful deal on climate has proved an elusive goal. The first try, in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997, committed advanced nations to reduce emissions between 1990 and 2010. But they actually achieved more in terms of reducing dependency on fossil fuels in the decade before the agreement than in the decade after. If the Kyoto target survived, it was only because of other forces: First, the collapse of the Soviet bloc wiped out a lot of European carbon emissions along with the decrepit Eastern European industrial base then the global downturn that started in 2008 reduced carbon emissions along with economic growth. Even the most aggressive proposals by the Obama administration probably packed less punch than supporters believe. President Obama’s original    bill, which was blocked in the Senate in 2009, proposed emissions limits that were higher than what emissions have turned out to be. The steep decline was driven not just by the recession and slow recovery, but also by the wholesale move by the power sector over the last decade from coal to less polluting natural gas. As Robert Stavins of Harvard University put it, “The most important factor in terms of carbon emissions in the United States is the price of natural gas. ” And for all the   over the future of the Clean Power Plan, its demise might not even make that much of a difference. The shift from coal to gas will continue to happen anyway. A study commissioned last December by the Environmental Defense Fund concluded that most states could comply “by relying exclusively on existing generation, investments already planned within each state and implementation of respective existing state policies. ” Of course, President Trump could do much more than simply stopping the Clean Power Plan, especially if he had eight years to work with. But why would he do that? Production tax credits for renewables have already been extended by a   Congress until 2021. Mr. Trump supports nuclear energy, and could well be persuaded to extend federal subsidies to keep the nation’s teetering string of nuclear plants in operation. Most importantly, climate objectives could mesh with Mr. Trump’s goal of energy independence. According to the 2016 edition of the International Energy Agency’s World Energy Outlook, the United States could pretty much become energy independent by 2040  —   reducing its annual oil imports to 1 million barrels a day from 6 million in 2014  —   as long as Washington sticks to current policies. Part of this has to do with rising shale oil and gas production. But the main driver would be efficiency. The Trump administration only has to maintain the Obama administration’s CAFE standards, which require the average fuel economy of cars and light trucks to rise to    miles per gallon by 2025, from 34 today. This is not to say that the world could survive forever an American administration that doesn’t believe in climate change and does nothing to contain it. A recent analysis by scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology concluded that the promises made in Paris would reduce the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at the end of the century to 710 parts per million from 750. That is still far from the 450 p. p. m. ceiling needed to tip the odds in favor of staying under the temperature threshold scientists consider safe. According to the International Energy Agency, the commitments made in Paris will cap the growth of greenhouse gas emissions between now and 2040 to 13 percent. The 450 p. p. m. target requires them to fall by 43 percent. Getting there will require rich countries like the United States to help finance much of the transition for poor countries. The role of global diplomacy will rise. “It will be a big deal that will affect economic growth and jobs,” said David Victor of the School of Global Policy and Strategy at the University of California, San Diego. “We need a strategy to assure countries that their economic competitors are undertaking similar types of policies. ” For this to work, the United States, as the dominant economic player, must play ball. Simply pursuing energy independence will not go far enough. In four years, the United States might have an administration that is less hostile to the concept of climate change. In any case, the rationale for policies to support   and   energy sources will be even stronger then than it is today. “If a Trump administration lasts only four years, the process could maybe absorb that,” said Oliver Geden, head of research at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. The bomb is ticking, but the world still has some time.",0
57037,Elton John Cancels Shows after Contracting ’Potentially Deadly’ Infection,"Elton John has cancelled all of his upcoming concerts in Las Vegas after contracting a rare and “potentially deadly” infection while touring in South America. [A representative for John said Monday that the    “Rocket Man”   would no longer be able to honor the April and May dates of his Las Vegas residency, “The Million Dollar Piano,” due to an extended stay in a hospital recovering from the rare illness.  “During a recent, successful tour of South America, Elton contracted a harmful and unusual bacterial infection,” the singer’s representative said in a statement obtained by People magazine. “During his return flight home from Santiago, Chile, he became violently ill. Upon returning to the U. K. Elton’s doctors admitted him to hospital, where he underwent immediate treatment to remove the infection. ” “After spending two nights in intensive care followed by an extended stay in hospital, Elton was released from hospital on Saturday, April 22 and is now comfortably resting at home per doctor’s advice,” the statement added. “Infections of this nature are rare and potentially deadly. Thankfully, Elton’s medical team identified this quickly and treated it successfully. ” The representative said John is expected to make a “full and complete recovery. ” The pianist’s scheduled performance on May 6 in Bakersfield, California has also been cancelled.  “I am so fortunate to have the most incredible and loyal fans and apologise for disappointing them,” John said in his own statement. “I am extremely grateful to the medical team for their excellence in looking after me so well. ” John is expected to return to the stage June 3 with a concert in Twickenham, England. It was not immediately clear whether the cancelled concerts would be rescheduled.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum",0

49432,"HILLARY CLINTON FOR PRESIDENT
","In any normal election year, wed compare the two presidential candidates side by side on the issues. But this is not a normal election year. A comparison like that would be an empty exercise in a race where one candidate  our choice, Hillary Clinton  has a record of service and a raft of pragmatic ideas, and the other, Donald Trump, discloses nothing concrete about himself or his plans while promising the moon and offering the stars on layaway. (We will explain in a subsequent editorial why we believe Mr. Trump to be the worst nominee put forward by a major party in modern American history.)

But this endorsement would also be an empty exercise if it merely affirmed the choice of Clinton supporters. Were aiming instead to persuade those of you who are hesitating to vote for Mrs. Clinton  because you are reluctant to vote for a Democrat, or for another Clinton, or for a candidate who might appear, on the surface, not to offer change from an establishment that seems indifferent and a political system that seems broken.

Running down the other guy wont suffice to make that argument. The best case for Hillary Clinton cannot be, and is not, that she isnt Donald Trump.

The best case is, instead, about the challenges this country faces, and Mrs. Clintons capacity to rise to them.

Can Hillary Clinton Keep You Safe? SEPT. 24, 2016
The next president will take office with bigoted, tribalist movements and their leaders on the march. In the Middle East and across Asia, in Russia and Eastern Europe, even in Britain and the United States, war, terrorism and the pressures of globalization are eroding democratic values, fraying alliances and challenging the ideals of tolerance and charity.

The 2016 campaign has brought to the surface the despair and rage of poor and middle-class Americans who say their government has done little to ease the burdens that recession, technological change, foreign competition and war have heaped on their families.

Over 40 years in public life, Hillary Clinton has studied these forces and weighed responses to these problems. Our endorsement is rooted in respect for her intellect, experience, toughness and courage over a career of almost continuous public service, often as the first or only woman in the arena.",0

38363, Ron Paul Blames Obama For A Stock Market Crash That Hasn’t Happened Yet,"Ron Paul, who s a retired doctor, not an economist, has a prediction that in the very near future, the stock market will lose half its value. Guess who would be to blame? Why it s the black guy, of course. A 50 percent pullback is conceivable,  Paul said on  Futures Now  recently.  I don t believe it s ten years off. I don t even believe it s a year off. According to his calculations, it would cut the S&P 500 Index in half, to 1212, and the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average would collapse to 10,837.Paul noted that there s a lot of chaos in Washington right now, with an  unpredictable president  and those who are inclined to  tear him apart  but if the market takes that big of a tumble, he doesn t see it as Trump s fault. It s all man-made. It s not the fault of Donald Trump in the last week. If the market crashes tomorrow and we have a great depression, he didn t do it in six months. It took more like six or ten years to cause all these problems that we re facing,  he said.Source: CNBCSix to 10 years ago, hmmm, who was in office for the vast majority of that time?Paul has spent much of his career as an economic doomsdayer, and sometimes it sounds like he s right, just because, well, broken clocks and all Two years ago, he predicted nearly the same collapse, but he had a solution, which could be anyone s for just $49.50   for sale on his website, of course.As part of an infomercial for Stansberry & Associates Investment Research, Ron Paul warned that a currency crisis  of epic proportions  would arrive soon and prophesied that life in America was  guaranteed to end in disaster  as  a total breakdown of the stock market  would lead to  civil unrest  and  authoritarian clampdowns.  Paul said people could avoid   and even benefit from   the collapse by purchasing Stansberry s  Survival Blueprint  for weathering the coming catastrophe for $49.50.Source: CNNThe only thing Ron Paul hates more than regulations and the Federal Reserve, is a more diverse society. He s a long-avowed racist who was never a fan of President Obama. In March, Paul s institute ran a blog post that accused Obama of sabotaging Trump.He s also a big believer in the  Deep State,  which is a shadow government that really runs the United States. According to another blog post, Obama is still part of that deep state.A 50 percent drop in the stock market would be disastrous for our economy, but as I mentioned, Paul is not an economist. He arguably predicted the real estate crash, but so did a lot of economists. Paul, like his buddy Alex Jones, is full of doomsday predictions and he has books to sell. If such a drop happens, you might be able to point fingers at some Obama policies, but it s Trump who s scaring the hell out of everyone, including investors. If we crash, Trump is driving the bus and he will get the blame   at least from most people.Featured image via Pete Marovich/Getty Images",1
2286,The Deep State Is Split on Killery,"Zero Hedge November 1, 2016 
With both Harry Reid and Hillary Clinton voicing extreme accusations of violating federal law against FBI Director Comey’s decision to be transparent about his investigation into Clinton’s emails, it appears President Obama is having none of it. As White House spokesman Josh Earnest stated: “President Obama doesn’t think Comey is trying to influence the election.” 
Senate minority leader Harry Reid claiming Comey may have violated federal law… 
“I am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act,” Reid wrote in a letter to Comey, according to the Wall Street Journal. 
The Hatch act prohibits government officials from using their positions to influence an election. 
“Through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law.” 
“When Republicans filibustered your nomination and delayed your confirmation longer than any previous nominee to your position, I led the fight to get you confirmed because I believed you to be a principled public servant,” Reid wrote. 
“With the deepest regret, I now see that I was wrong.” 
But, President Obama has now crushed that narrative: 
John Earnest explains: 
“President Obama doesn’t think Comey tried to influence the election.” 
“Obama still believes Comey has “good character”” 
“Obama has a lot of confidence in AG Loretta Lynch” 
Which, roughly translated into images is this… 

Furthermore, as we noted last night , Harry Reid had suggested that ” talked w/ top NatSec officials who say that Comey “possesses explosive information” about Trump’s ties to Russia.” 
That has also been completely rebuffed as The White House says it “has not been briefed on the existence of any FBI investigation on activities, habts of Donald Trump.” 
So more lies?!",1
45869,Irish foreign minister says Brexit border breakthrough possible on Monday,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - No agreement has yet been reached between Britain and Ireland on the future of the Northern Irish border, but the breakthrough required to allow wider Brexit talks to proceed could come later on Monday, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said. British Prime Minister Theresa May hopes to break the Brexit talks deadlock on Monday with a new offer on divorce settlements at a crunch meeting with EU officials, but she has not yet achieved  sufficient progress  on the Irish border - one of three issues that must be resolved. Coveney said the talks were in a  sensitive place  with the two governments discussing possible texts of an agreement, which is a prerequisite for Britain to start discussions on a new trade pact and a two-year transitional deal.  We re not quite yet where we need to be. But it is possible to do that today,  Coveney told Irish state broadcaster RTE.  Hopefully we ll find a way forward today,  he said. Ireland has called on Britain to provide details of how it will ensure there is no  regulatory divergence  after Brexit in March 2019 that would require physical border controls. But any solution will need the support of Northern Ireland s pro-Brexit Democratic Unionist Party, whose 10 members of parliament are propping up May s government. Coveney said that draft texts were produced following progress in talks last Thursday and that discussions had continued over the weekend.   There are political conversations happening in both governments in relation to that text,  he said.  Both governments understand what each other is asking for.   ",0
29167, John Kasich Tells GOP Chair Reince Priebus To Go F*ck Himself,"Reince Priebus openly threatened Kasich and other Republicans that they better blindly support Donald Trump or face the end of their careers. John Kasich doesn t give a shit about Priebus  pathetic threats.On Sunday, the GOP Chair suggested that Republicans who don t fall in line behind Trump could be severely punished in their endeavors to seek election or re-election. Those people need to get on board,  Priebus told Face The Nation: And if they re thinking they re going to run again someday, I think that we re going to evaluate the process   of the nomination process and I don t think it s going to be that easy for them. In order to be on the ballot in South Carolina, you actually have to pledge your support to the nominee, no matter who that person is. So what s the penalty for that? It s not a threat, but that s just the question that we have a process in place. Kasich has repeatedly refused to endorse Donald Trump and did not take kindly to Priebus  threat, issuing a brutal response through his spokesman John Weaver. Thankfully, there are still leaders in this country who put principles before politics. The idea of a greater purpose beyond oneself may be alien to political party bosses like Reince Priebus, but it is at the center of everything Governor Kasich does The Governor is traveling the nation supporting down ballot Republicans and preventing a potential national wipeout from occurring on Reince s watch. Weaver also added that Priebus should be thanking Kasich.So the next time John Kasich seeks re-election or high office it s going to be interesting to watch how Priebus responds. Will he follow through on his threat or will he do an about-face and all of a sudden support Kasich?Threatening someone with political ruin just because they don t support the terrible choice of nominee your party made sounds more like what dictators or fascists do. It s definitely not the hallmark of a party that supposedly supports our democracy. Because by trying to force Republicans to vote a certain way, they are undermining democracy and all the values this country was founded upon.If anyone deserves political backlash, it s Reince Priebus. He created a political atmosphere so toxic that they now have Trump as their leader. The Republicans standing against Trump are the sane ones.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",1
54595,"U.N. rights chief decries hunger in Syrian siege, demands aid access","GENEVA (Reuters) - The humanitarian situation in the besieged eastern suburbs of Damascus is  an outrage  and parties to the conflict must allow food and medicine to reach at least 350,000 trapped Syrians, U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra ad al-Hussein said on Friday.  The shocking images of what appear to be severely malnourished children that have emerged in recent days are a frightening indication of the plight of people in Eastern Ghouta, who are now facing a humanitarian emergency,  Zeid said in a statement. The tightening siege has pushed people to the verge of famine in the rebel enclave, residents and aid workers have told Reuters.  I remind all parties that the deliberate starvation of civilians as a method of warfare constitutes a clear violation of international humanitarian law, and may amount to a crime against humanity and/or a war crime,  Zeid said. Zeid s office had a list of several hundred people who needed medical evacuation, but the government had reportedly imposed severe restrictions on such evacuations, leading to the deaths of several civilians, the U.N. statement said.  A U.N. convoy last reached the besieged area on Sept 23, with aid for 25,000 people. Food prices have rocketed since forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad took control of several neighborhoods in May and destroyed tunnels that had been used to smuggle goods into the siege. This month they closed Eastern Ghouta s main access checkpoint and imposed a big rise in taxes imposed on traders. Last week two food warehouses were looted in  a possible sign of growing desperation , the U.N. statement said. ",0

71026,Pollsters who predicted Trump win benefit from industry's miss,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A handful of small public opinion polling companies that bucked consensus and accurately called the U.S. presidential election for Republican Donald Trump are reporting being flooded with calls from investors and clients seeking their services.  Most pollsters wrongly forecast Democrat Hillary Clinton as leading Trump ahead of Tuesday’s election in the latest fiasco to hit the $20 billion public opinion research industry, only months after it failed to predict the British vote to leave the European Union in a June referendum. Among the few that got it right was a new industry player using a different method, South African firm Brandseye, which analyzes social media posts. With offices in Capetown and Johannesburg, Brandseye took an entirely different approach from traditional polling. The data-miner pays people around the world to sift through social media for relevant posts, a process known as crowd-sourcing, and then uses a computer algorithm to rate consumer sentiment about products or politicians.  Its method pointed to a Trump victory. It also correctly called Britain’s Brexit vote. “My phone has not stopped,” CEO and part owner JP Kloppers said in a telephone interview on Thursday. Kloppers said venture capitalists have been calling about investing in the firm, and polling companies have inquired about its methods. Kloppers said the company was open to licensing its technology. Existing clients include ride-sharing firm Uber, banks, telecommunications firms and some government agencies, he said. He declined to identify the governments. “Elections come every couple of years, but there are companies and governments that need to understand every day and every week what’s driving customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction,” Kloppers said. New methods, if successful, are of high interest to polling companies that are having difficulty reaching cellphone users or survey-weary Americans.  “The answer is ongoing research,” said Krista Jenkins, director of the PublicMind survey research center at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey. “It’s basically digging in as an industry and comparing the findings from your traditional telephone polls to data that is collected online.” Traditional pollsters base their results on questions posed to randomly selected people, often in interviews conducted live over the telephone. Among other errors that pollsters made ahead of the U.S election, they almost universally miscalculated how turnout would be distributed among demographic groups. High-profile London-based polling agency YouGov PLC’s stock dropped 4 percent on Wednesday after its new method of surveying people online failed to accurately predict the U.S. presidential election’s outcome. Analysts were split on the reason behind the drop, and YouGov stock partly recovered on Thursday, closing up 2 percent in London trading.  No one from YouGov, which primarily does research for corporations, was immediately available to comment on the business implications of the polling miss, a spokesman said. The Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project gave Clinton a 90 percent probability of winning the 270 electoral votes needed to secure the election. On its website, one of the possible scenarios was how Trump could win the election by adjusting turnout levels. Ipsos SA will assess what it got wrong, said Clifford Young, president of the French research company’s U.S. public affairs unit. Election polling is generally not a big money-maker. Many polls are done by universities or the media, while private research companies use it to market themselves to corporate clients that provide more profitable work. Pioneering U.S. pollster Gallup last year abandoned head-to-head polls for the presidential race, saying it wanted to focus its resources on polls about issues. The outfits that wrongly foresaw a Clinton victory will suffer damage to their reputation, said Alex DeGroote, a London-based analyst at Peel Hunt LLP who follows the industry. “They attach their brand to these polls. If these polls continue to flop, it’s not going to help their brand credibility,” DeGroote said. Among this year’s winners may be Remington Research Group. The Kansas City, Missouri-based pollster correctly predicted that Trump would win the election battleground states of Florida, North Carolina and Ohio, although it missed Trump’s surprising Wisconsin victory. The company, which frequently works with Republican politicians, conducts a mix of automated phone interviews and live phone interviews. It may have done relatively well because other firms were afraid of standing out from the crowd, said Titus Bond, the group’s director. “A lot of pollsters, they want to be at the same number as everyone else,” Bond said. Bond said he received three calls on the morning after the election from corporate clients in the pharmaceutical and fertilizer industries and three others from advocacy groups, all seeking to do business.

47550,Philippines declares battle with Islamist rebels over in Marawi City,"MARAWI CITY/CLARK, Philippines (Reuters) - The Philippines on Monday announced the end of five months of military operations in a southern city held by pro-Islamic State rebels, after a fierce and unfamiliar urban war that has marked the country s biggest security crisis in years. Offensive combat operations were terminated after troops put a stop to the last stand of rebel gunmen who clung on inside several buildings in the heart of Marawi, and refused to surrender. Artillery and automatic gunfire were still heard on Monday and Reuters journalists saw flames behind a mosque. The bodies of 40 fighters and two of their wives were found there and in two buildings close by.  Ernesto Abella, spokesman for President Rodrigo Duterte, said the Philippines had prevailed against  the most serious threat of violent extremism and radicalism in the Philippines and in Southeast Asia .  Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said the security forces had  nipped the budding infrastructure  of extremist groups.   In crushing thus far the most serious attempt to export violent extremism and radicalism in the Philippines and in the region, we have contributed to preventing its spread in Asia,  Lorenzana said in Clark at a meeting of regional defense ministers. The rebel occupation stunned a military inexperienced in urban combat and stoked wider concerns that Islamic State loyalists have gained influence among local Muslims and have ambitions to use the island of Mindanao as a base for operations in Southeast Asia. Those fears are compounded by the organization of the militant alliance and its ability to recruit young fighters, lure foreign radicals, stockpile huge amounts of arms and endure 154 days of ground offensive and air strikes. The authorities said 920 militants, 165 troops and police and at least 45 civilians were killed in the conflict, which displaced more than 300,000 people. The center of the picturesque lakeside town is now in ruins due to heavy shelling and aerial bombing. The deputy task force commander in Marawi, Colonel Romeo Brawner, said troops would secure the city from militant  stragglers  who might still be alive.  If we find them and they will attack our soldiers or even the civilians, then we will have to defend ourselves,  he told reporters.    After months of slow progress, the military has made significant gains in retaking Marawi in the week since Isnilon Hapilon, Islamic State s  emir  in Southeast Asia and Omarkhayam Maute, a leader of the Maute militant group, were killed in a nighttime operation. Another leader and possible bankroller of the operation, Malaysian Mahmud Ahmad, was likely killed also, the military said. Military spokesman, Major General Restituto Padilla, confirmed there was still gunfire ongoing, but there were  no more terrorists  and the army s last battles were with an enemy decimated by the loss of its leadership.  They were formless, they had no place to run,  he said.      Duterte had declared Marawi City liberated six days ago, even though fighting was not actually over. On Sunday, he said it was important to be vigilant because no country could escape Islamic State s  clutches of evil .  I m not trying to scare you, but let s just be prepared for any event,  he said. Lorenzana said six battalions of troops would remain in Marawi and though the battle had been won, the enemy s radical ideology had not been completely annihilated.  He thanked the United States, Australia, Singapore and China for providing weaponry and technical support, including surveillance aircraft, and said the conflict would be a catalyst for closer international cooperation against extremism. The government estimates the rebuilding of the heart of Marawi could cost in excess of $1 billion.  ",0
41902,A Trip to ‘Mars’ Signals a New Look for National Geographic Channel - The New York Times,"LOS ANGELES  —   Over the last year, the National Geographic Channel has turned itself inside out. Gone are derivative,   reality shows set in Alaska. Arriving are lavish productions like “Mars,” a   from an   team that began on Monday. Even as it spends more on less  —   about $400 million a year for 150 hours of programming, compared with $300 million for 450 hours before  —   the channel has cut advertising minutes by up to 50 percent. Will this   of National Geographic succeed? Some people in the television business think the answer is no. But James Murdoch, now in his second year as chief executive of 21st Century Fox, is betting that his unorthodox plan signifies the future  —   how   networks like National Geographic must evolve if they are going to survive (and, hopefully, thrive) in a rapidly changing media environment. The overhaul is Mr. Murdoch’s first major entertainment initiative. “It’s not really a linear ratings game anymore,” he said in an interview about the channel, which is   by Fox. “It’s about creating demand across platforms, and part of the way to do that is to have programming that is big and commands attention. The last thing you can be in this world is disposable. ” After sauntering along for years without posing any real threat, National Geographic and other lightly viewed channels  —   CMT, Oxygen, truTV  —   are now facing a     future. Younger viewers increasingly live in an   world, where networks don’t matter. Tired of paying for channels they rarely watch, consumers are downsizing to   skinny core bundles or forgoing pay television altogether. “National Geographic has not been considered a   network,” said Anthony DiClemente, an analyst with Instinet.   series represent National Geographic’s effort to avoid getting squeezed out. Fox also hopes to convince distributors like Comcast and ATT to pay more to carry National Geographic. The channel, available in 91 million homes in the United States, receives about 23 cents per subscriber per month, according to SNL Kagan. Discovery Channel, in comparison, receives almost double that amount. In many ways, the new National Geographic plan is similar to the one Fox has long used at FX, home to prestige dramas like “Fargo. ” “Premium is a word we are using exhaustively now,” said Courteney Monroe, a former marketer for HBO and others who was named chief executive of National Geographic Global Networks last year. “Entertaining and smart are not mutually exclusive. ” “Mars” marks the hairpin turn. The $20 million   produced by a team that includes the   pair Ron Howard and Brian Grazer, mixes scripted drama and documentary sequences in a story about efforts by humans to colonize the red planet. The fictionalized portion looks at a crewed mission to Mars in 2033. Interviews with scientists and footage taped at SpaceX, the aerospace firm founded by Elon Musk, make up the rest. Mr. Grazer said he first pitched the expensive project to Peter Rice, chief executive of Fox Networks Group, over lunch. “It was the fastest ‘yes’ I think I’ve ever gotten,” he said, emphasizing that Mr. Rice has played an important role in National Geographic’s turn. Mr. Grazer described Ms. Monroe, who has limited programming experience, as “high quality, a big thinker, the opposite of petty, someone who will forgive the little things to get to the big things. ” In the pipeline behind “Mars” are ambitious scripted projects like “Genius,” an anthology series, and “Dragon Teeth,” a limited series from Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Television. These kinds of efforts, which Declan Moore, chief executive of National Geographic Partners, called “exciting, adventurous, audacious, awesome,” are designed to attract cable viewers who are tired of rote reality shows. Mr. Moore plans to monetize viewing across platforms (video on demand, streaming services, iTunes, DVD) while profiting through improved corporate synergy. There are “Mars”  books from a publishing division the titular   magazine has Mars on its cover and digital channels (National Geographic is the No. 1 noncelebrity brand on Instagram) will also push out “Mars”  content. Much of what Fox is doing runs counter to conventional business methods, leading some rivals to scratch their heads. Specials are great, but what fills all the hours in between? And since when is the game not about linear ratings? A recent stunt by National Geographic was seen as particularly odd. The channel paid millions of dollars for “Before the Flood,” a climate change documentary produced by a team that included Leonardo DiCaprio, and after running it a couple of times, the channel gave it away for free on YouTube. National Geographic executives readily acknowledge that they will not make money on the film rather, they always saw it as a   effort. National Geographic, after all, got its start in 1888 as an academic society dedicated to spreading geographic knowledge. A company spokesman, Christopher Albert, said the film was viewed, at least in part, by roughly 64 million people worldwide. “We see this as a really big success,” he said. National Geographic Channel has a long history overseas, where it reaches more than 350 million homes. But it became a   network in the United States only in 2001. There was no real cable niche left to fill, so the channel, then a partnership between Fox and the National Geographic Society, largely copied the reality show playbooks of competitors. It worked only modestly, and serious society members recoiled at lowbrow efforts like “Taboo” and “Meet the Hutterites. ” “We sort of never lived up to the potential of the brand,” Ms. Monroe said. Then the media business started to fray. National Geographic magazine, with its   photography, watched as subscriptions dwindled, putting pressure on the affiliated National Geographic Society, a nonprofit dedicated to   pursuits. And the television apparatus started to encounter challenges of its own. Last year, 21st Century Fox paid $725 million to buy the bulk of the National Geographic Society’s business holdings. Together they created a new company, National Geographic Partners, which encompasses television, print publications, maps, digital media, children’s media, licensing and tours. The partners share governance, but Fox owns 73 percent of the venture. The National Geographic Society continued as a separate nonprofit. Even as the channel’s new programming strategy has prompted questions, it has answered others. Some purists were outraged by the Fox deal. As the primatologist Jane Goodall told a Canadian interviewer: “I truly thought it was a joke. This can’t be true. National Geographic, the National Geographic, being owned almost entirely by Fox News, which is filled with climate deniers and almost   science?” A year later, those worries have dissipated. Gary E. Knell, chief executive of the National Geographic Society, said he has been thrilled by the   programming. And he noted that his philanthropy suddenly has lots of money to spend. The society recently announced an expedition to document the sources of the Cuando River in the remote highlands of Angola as part of an effort to protect its ecosystem. “Most nonprofits spend most of their time ” Mr. Knell said. “We now spend our time thinking about how to change the world. ”",0
61168,[VIDEO] BUMBLING US DEFENSE SEC. CAN’T ANSWER QUESTION ABOUT Whether Or Not We’ll Defend The 60 Syrians We’re Training To Fight ISIS,"Yeah you know the Obama regime is serious about taking down ISIS when they send in 60 Syrian rebels and leave them unprotected against the Assad regime.  Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) went straight for the jugular in questioning Defense Secretary Ash Carter at a Tuesday Senate hearing on the Obama administration s strategy against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.McCain criticized President Obama s comments at the Pentagon on Monday citing recent progress against ISIS as delusional, and he ripped Carter over the Pentagon s slowness in training Syrian rebels.He said ISIS overall is gaining territory in Iraq and Syria and that there is  no compelling reason  to believe the administration s strategy is going to succeed in limiting the group. McCain disparaged the Pentagon for failing to provide military support to the few Syrian rebels it is training after Carter said the military would decide how to provide support once they are in the field. Via: The HillSenator John McCain: And is it true that with these people that you are training and equipping to fight in Syria that they re only there to fight ISIS and not Bashar Assad? Is that true?US Defense Secretary Carter: Ah..we re uh..yes, we are telling them to uh uh that we  arming and uh .training them uh in the first instance, to go after ISIL and not uh..the Assad regime and that is our priority.  McCain:So, in other words if they are barrel bombed by Bashar Assad, they are not Carter: No I think we have SOME obligation to them once they re inserted in the field. Again, we don t expect them to be McCain: Is that to defend them against barrel bombing?Carter: Well that decision will be made when we introduce fighters into the field.McCain: That s a small comfort to those people you re recruiting right now that that decision will be made later on.Is that fair to these young men to say: We are sending you in to fight ISIS only, and by the way, we will decide on the policy whether to defend you if you are barrel bombed?Carter: They know that we will provide support to them. Exactly what kind of support McCain: Does that mean you will defend them against Bashar Assad s barrel bombing?McCain s final question: So you re recruiting them, but not telling them that you ll defend them because you haven t made a decision yet? And yet you want to train them quickly and send them in?",1
20589,'Trump dossier' on Russia links now part of special counsel's probe: sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The special counsel investigating whether Russia tried to sway the 2016 U.S. election has taken over FBI inquiries into a former British spy s dossier of allegations of Russian financial and personal links to President Donald Trump s campaign and associates, sources familiar with the inquiry told Reuters. A report compiled by former MI6 officer Christopher Steele identified Russian businessmen and others whom U.S. intelligence analysts have concluded are Russian intelligence officers or working on behalf of the Russian government. A spokesman for special counsel Robert Mueller declined comment. The FBI also declined comment. Three sources with knowledge of Mueller s probe said his investigators have assumed control of multiple inquiries into allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the election to benefit Trump, a Republican. Russia has repeatedly denied any meddling in the election. Two officials familiar with the investigations said that both Mueller s team and the Senate Intelligence Committee are seeking any evidence that former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort or others who had financial dealings with Russia might have helped Kremlin intelligence agencies target email hacking and social media postings undermining Trump s election opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton. On Wednesday, the Senate panel s chairman Richard Burr told reporters that the issue of whether Trump s campaign colluded with Russia remains an open question.  We have not come to any determination on collusion,  Burr said. Trump, who has called allegations of campaign collusion with Moscow a hoax, has faced questions about the matter since he took office in January.     Trump was told by former FBI director James Comey that Steele s report contained salacious material about the businessman-turned-president. Burr said on Wednesday that the Senate panel had made several attempts to contact Steele and to meet him and  those offers have gone unaccepted.   The committee cannot really decide the credibility of the dossier without understanding things like who paid for it, who are your sources and sub-sources,  Burr said.  Burr said the panel wanted to finish its investigation by the end of the year. Although several news organizations, including Reuters, were briefed on Steele s dossier before the election in November, most decided not to report on the material because its inflammatory and sometimes salacious content could not be verified. In a report published in January four U.S. intelligence agencies said they took the dossier s allegations seriously. Separately, three Russian businessmen, Mikhail Fridman, Petr Aven and German Khan have sued Washington investigations firm Fusion GPS and its founder, Glenn Simpson, with allegations that they were libeled in Steele s dossier. A spokeswoman for Simpson and Fusion GPS declined to comment on the lawsuit filed on Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Washington. The lawsuit said that Steele s reports were  gravely damaging  to the businessmen because they accused them  of criminal conduct and alleged cooperation with the  Kremlin  to influence the 2016 presidential election.   The information on Trump collected by Steele, whom officials say was one of MI6 s most respected Russia hands, was laid out last year in political  opposition research  initially financed by supporters of one of Trump s Republican primary election opponents. After Trump won the Republican nomination in July, backers of Clinton picked up the support of Steele s work. The lawsuit said the dossier s allegations are false in implying an improper  ongoing  relationship between the businessmen, the Alfa Group financial company in which they were investors and Russian President Vladimir Putin, and that a Russian government official acted as middleman in such contacts.

69730,Kelly Ripa’s Absence From ‘Live’ Points to Rancor at ABC - The New York Times,"It seemed like an innocent enough announcement: Michael Strahan, the former football player turned television personality, was shifting assignments on ABC’s morning lineup, the network said Tuesday. He would leave “Live With Kelly and Michael” in September to become a   on “Good Morning America. ” But there was rancor behind the scenes. Mr. Strahan’s   Kelly Ripa, was told of the move just minutes before the announcement, and felt blindsided, said a person who has spoken to her about ABC’s decision. And she made little attempt to conceal her displeasure, skipping Wednesday’s edition on “Live. ” ABC said she would not appear on the show for the rest of the week and would be replaced by Erin Andrews. Ms. Ripa’s absence Wednesday forced Mr. Strahan into the awkward position of addressing the news of his departure with a guest host, Ana Gasteyer, a former “Saturday Night Live” cast member. After Mr. Strahan and Ms. Gasteyer danced their way to the hosts’ desk on the “Live” set, Mr. Strahan said, “I’ve been in the news lately,” before formally announcing that he was leaving. For ABC, what was supposed to be a boost to its morning lineup is instead developing into a giant headache with one of its most prominent stars. Ms. Ripa, who joined the show in 2001, replacing Kathy Lee Gifford, has developed a loyal following of her own. In addition to Ms. Ripa’s apparent displeasure, “Good Morning America” is also presenting the network with cause for concern. Though it remains the   morning show, it’s down 10 percent in total viewers and 18 percent in the      demographic important to advertisers. It is second in that age bracket to NBC’s “Today,” a show that experienced its own ratings difficulties four years ago when it botched Ann Curry’s departure. When Mr. Strahan does join “Good Morning America” in a   role in September, he will be accustomed to the surroundings. He began as an   correspondent for “Good Morning America” two years ago, a decision that Ms. Ripa expressed concerns about at the time, according to the person. Ms. Ripa was worried it would distract him from “Live” but was reassured it would only be a temporary position. Mr. Strahan continued to appear on the morning show, and ABC executives recently decided that bringing him into the “Good Morning America” lineup could help stem the ratings drop. After “Live” ended on Tuesday morning, Ms. Ripa was called to a meeting along with the show’s longtime producer, Michael Gelman, and the WABC general manager, Dave Davis (the show is produced by WABC, and it is distributed by ABC and Disney’s syndication group). She did not know the purpose of the meeting. After a   wait, Mr. Strahan entered the room and broke the news that he was leaving. It wasn’t long before tensions flared. “Didn’t I tell you this was going to happen?” Ms. Ripa said to Mr. Davis at the meeting, according to the person. “I told you two years ago this was going to happen. ” A few minutes after the meeting ended, ABC publicly announced Mr. Strahan’s departure. Ms. Ripa later let the network know she would not appear on Wednesday. Ms. Ripa was angry, this person said, because she perceived that “Good Morning America” was being given priority over “Live. ” Ms. Ripa declined to comment. Ms. Ripa was similarly caught off guard in 2011 when Regis Philbin informed her 20 minutes before show time that he was going to announce his departure on that edition of “Live. ” After Mr. Philbin left the show, “Live” began an open casting call to replace him, cycling in more than a dozen potential   to sit beside Ms. Ripa. After 10 months, ABC selected Mr. Strahan, who is also a commentator on Fox’s N. F. L. pregame show. In a statement, an ABC spokeswoman said: “‘Live’ continues to be a vibrant and enduring franchise under our lead host, the extraordinarily talented Kelly Ripa. ‘Live’ has successfully transitioned   twice before and will do so again. Together with Kelly, ABC and the ‘Live’ team will begin a new search to find a replacement for Michael. ” It appears that Ms. Ripa’s absence will be an extended one: “Live” is not scheduled to shoot on Friday and she had already arranged to take Monday off for a long weekend to celebrate her 20thwedding anniversary, the person said. Friday’s show will be taped on Thursday, so Ms. Andrews will appear for the next two editions of “Live. ” Ms. Ripa will be replaced by the “Pretty Little Liars” actress Shay Mitchell on Monday, an ABC spokeswoman said.",0
65900,How to Interpret the Trump Administration’s Latest Signals on Mexico - The New York Times,"The White House floated an idea on Thursday afternoon that, in initial reports, sounded like a major tariff on Mexican imports  —   something that would have gone a long way toward unwinding one of the United States’ deepest economic relationships. The reality of what Sean Spicer, the press secretary, suggested is a lot less dramatic. But it sends important signals about how people in the Trump administration are thinking about overhauling the tax code  —   and how they’re thinking about claiming victory on some of the president’s audacious campaign promises. It is a sign of just how fluid things are in this moment when so much of American public policy around taxes, trade and diplomacy is in flux. Mr. Spicer suggested a way the administration could accomplish President Trump’s goal of building a border wall paid for by Mexico. A 20 percent tax on imports from Mexico would do the trick, Mr. Spicer said. That might sound as if Mr. Spicer was proposing that the United States slap a new tariff meant to punish Mexican exporters. Such a move would result in higher prices for American consumers, create profound challenges for industries with supply chains that span the border, and possibly prompt the collapse of the North American Free Trade Agreement. But you get a different picture when you put Mr. Spicer’s words into the context of the rapidly evolving debate in Washington around overhauling corporate taxation. He was pointing out that in an overhaul of taxes that House Republicans are considering, imports from all countries would be taxed at 20 percent while American exports would be tax free. It’s called border adjustment, and it would make the United States corporate tax code more closely resemble the   tax that is commonplace in other countries. House Republicans see the policy as a way to reshape the tax code to give businesses less incentive to move operations overseas while also generating revenue they can use to reduce tax rates. Opponents of the plan, which include major retailers, are skeptical. Among the risks: It could drive up consumer prices for all sorts of imported goods, from German cars to Mexican avocados, if the dollar does not rise as much as economists predict. And the policy may violate World Trade Organization rules, which could tangle it up in legal proceedings. But that Mr. Spicer was floating that plan as a way to fulfill Mr. Trump’s Mexican wall promises is interesting on two levels. First, less than two weeks ago, the    threw cold water on the House plan. “Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don’t love it,” Mr. Trump told The Wall Street Journal. “Because usually it means we’re going to get adjusted into a bad deal. ” On Thursday, Mr. Spicer was explicitly suggesting that a border tax could be used to pay for a border wall. Referring to the tax plan, he said, “This is something that we’ve been in close contact with both houses in moving forward. ” The border adjustment strategy has plenty of enemies, and there’s no certainty that it will become part of a tax overhaul bill. But the latest tea leaves suggest the administration is more open to it than it may have seemed. The second lesson from the incident is that the Trump administration looks inclined to be flexible in finding ways to satisfy campaign promises without doing major damage to the economy or international relations. Thursday was one of the roughest days for relations between the United States and Mexico in some time, with the cancellation of a planned visit by President Enrique Peña Nieto and tough talk from Mexico City, which adamantly refuses to pay for an expansion of a border wall. But Mr. Spicer’s comments, which he later said were meant more to offer an example than a concrete policy proposal, suggest that the administration will look for creative ways to proclaim victory on Trumpian promises. In other words, he will proclaim that Mexico has paid for the wall as promised  —   even if the Mexican government never literally cuts a check to pay for new concrete. Advocates of the border adjustment tax have been fond of it because it would produce enough revenue to allow a deep reduction in tax rates. But money is fungible. So if the president can claim political victory by stating that the revenue from Mexican imports is going to pay for the wall, no one is going to stop him. It is a messy time for the making of economic policy. The Trump campaign was notoriously light on policy detail, and the Trump administration still has many key vacancies in economic policy jobs. Nominees for Treasury secretary, commerce secretary and U. S. trade representative have not yet been confirmed, and key jobs on the Council of Economic Advisers and most undersecretary and assistant secretary jobs remain unfilled. So the gaps are still being filled in on what the Trump administration economic policy will really mean in practice. The way to read the latest Mexico comments is as one more hint.",0

2273, WATCH: Trump Becomes Unhinged When Confronted About His Vulgar Language In Front Of Children,"Donald Trump continues to give American voters important clues and hints as to why we shouldn t vote for him. He fits the typical prototype for a demagogue, and his comments about minorities and women have rendered him the most divisive presidential candidate in modern history. His most recent act of idiocy came when a man confronted him with concerns over Trump s tendency to swear during debates and on the campaign trail.The man first asked Trump about a new ad targeting him over his use of words like,  motherf*cker,   p*ssy  and  a**  to describe his opponents and wanted to know whether Trump thought that was presidential. Trump said: I was a little concerned with that ad until I saw it. I think it s better than any ad I ve ever taken for myself. The man then pressed Trump more saying,  A lot of parents are trying to figure out how to explain some of the language they re hearing on the campaign trail.  That s when Trump threw a hissy fit and shot out a typical red herring, preferring to attack the man rather than address his valid question: Oh you re so politically correct, oh look at you. Oh I know, you ve never heard a little off-language. Aren t you just a perfect young man. You know it s stuff like that, that people in this country are tired of. I don t have children but one can only imagine the parenting skills required to explain Donald Trump, to explain how this individual is actually running for the most powerful position in the world and has support. The hope is that Americans can send a powerful message to their children and to the world by ensuring this character does not become president.Watch video here:Donald Trump responds when asked whether his use of vulgar words, highlighted in a critical new ad, is presidential.https://t.co/ht2rbbZPiS  NBC Nightly News (@NBCNightlyNews) March 10, 2016 Featured image via video screenshot",1
18388,The feds probably won't dismantle the Ferguson PD. That's a good thing.,"Attorney General Eric Holder said Friday he was ""prepared to use all the powers"" the federal government has to get the city of Ferguson, Missouri, in line with the Constitution. Asked if that included ""dismantling the police force,"" Holder said, ""If that's what's necessary, we're prepared to do that.""

It sounds like a radical move on Holder's part. But don't get too swept up in it. The DOJ doesn't exactly have the power to dismantle the Ferguson police department if the city doesn't consent — and would have to go through a lot of steps before getting that power. Plus, dismantling the embattled police department might not fix some of the worst problems outlined in the Justice Department's report.

The Department of Justice doesn't have the power to dismantle local police departments at will. The way it's probably going to ""work with"" the City of Ferguson, as Holder also hinted today, is by drawing up an agreement where Ferguson's police would still be independent, but would be monitored by the DOJ. (The agreement would be enforced in federal court.) The feds would only take over if the city failed, and failed badly, to make the changes laid out in the agreement.

This nearly happened in Oakland in 2012; as a compromise, the federal government fired the police chief but left the department under the city's control. But it was a full decade after the agreement was first signed.

if dismantling happens, it'll be something the city agrees to do itself — or even suggests to begin with

If Holder really wants to tear down the Ferguson Police Department and start over, the best way to do that would be to make dissolution part of the original court-enforced agreement. If the city didn't agree, he could sue them to do it (which would also take years).

But given how expensive it's going to be for Ferguson's police to comply with the likely court agreement, it might actually be cheaper for them to agree to give up and try again. So the possibility exists that the Ferguson police department will be dissolved — but it would almost certainly be because the city of Ferguson agreed to do it, or even suggested it in the first place. That also means the city would be in charge of putting together whatever is going to replace the Ferguson PD.

Getting rid of the police in Ferguson would only address half of the problems identified by the federal government. The Department of Justice also found massive discrimination and Constitutional violations in the municipal court system, including arresting people for showing up to court without being able to afford a court fee; suspending drivers' licenses of people who didn't even know that they'd had a court date, let alone missed one; and setting jail bonds not based on what someone would be able to pay, but based on making the most money for the city.

There's no way the federal government's going to be satisfied if Ferguson reforms its police but leaves its courts the way they are. Disbanding the police department might allow the city to focus on reforming the courts, but it won't be enough on its own.

More importantly, though, who would do police work in Ferguson after the Ferguson police force gets dismantled?

the actions of ""other law enforcement agencies in st. louis county...have contributed to a general distrust"" of police

Typically, a nearby police force is brought in to take over: either temporarily, while a new police department is hired from the chief down, or permanently, on a contract. And it's not at all clear whether other police departments in the St. Louis area are any better. After all, residents had plenty of experience with the St. Louis County police last summer during the protests after Michael Brown's death — and they didn't treat protesters any better than Ferguson police did.

The DOJ report certainly indicates that the problem in St. Louis is bigger than Ferguson. In fact, some of the things it faults the Ferguson police for doing are things they're being asked to do by other jurisdictions, like arresting people without warrants based on requests from police in other departments. By the same token, many of the unfair court practices the DOJ found appear to be pretty typical in municipal courts in the area.

The report even says: ""Individuals’ experiences with other law enforcement agencies in St. Louis County, including with the police departments in surrounding municipalities and the County Police, in many instances have contributed to a general distrust of law enforcement that impacts interactions with the Ferguson police and municipal court.""

If Eric Holder wants to dismantle the problems facing the criminal-justice system throughout the St. Louis area, he's welcome to try — but it's going to take a lot more investigations and potential lawsuits than the one he has going right now.",0
23219,Relentless Media Censorship Is Brining Us A Fate Worse Than Big Brother,"Do you really like sexy women like the one in the photo above? Are you sure? Big Brother Google says “Why don’t you look at this story about alternative lifestyles about men who have realized what terrible misogynists they are for having sexual desires?” rather than searching for articles on for pick-up artistry .
Sooner rather than later, all Internet roads will lead to the same New World Order Socialist philosophy.
As profiling of Internet users becomes more prolific and the algorithms more sophisticated in the coming years, the news and information we search for will be tailored to slowly “nudge” us one way or the other politically, one small step at a time.
The management of the information we get to read is already in its infancy.
Why do you think that “free” app on your phone that only performs a few functions swells in size with each “update” that is released? Do you really think they give a damn about your privacy and are plugging security holes? Hell no. The apps we download are moving from useful, low-resource using services to resource hogs (necessitating an upgrade in processing power every year or two) because they only provide us with a “free” service in order to hook us so the apps can gather information about everything we’ve ever written on our devices for social engineers and marketing flacks. The apps are becoming more sophisticated in the way they monitor everything we do – which is why the apps need all that memory size.
And soon, apps will be gathering information about everything we’ve ever said aloud by using the built in microphones on each device and speech recognition technology. CIA agents confirm microphones can easily be activated even when a device is switched completely off.
This type of information will be collected in giant databases such as the Utah Data Center, with the ultimate goal being the corporate-government complex knowing more about us than we know about ourselves.
Big Brother Was So Yesterday Orwell’s Big Brother idea never could have imagined the insidious nature of today’s information technology
Today’s information technology has put Big Brother on steroids.
The Waking Times details this frightful world that is already emerging as anyone who pays attention knows search engines are already tailoring information to what we search for and even what we text people about.
“Mr. X, we’ve studied the little virtual bubble you live in, and now we can sell you your own special brand of truth.”
Most of the time, the information one will see in this Internet bubble will be customized to suit a person’s interests. This is why Facebook relentlessly pushes the “Like a page or product” portion of its web site. This information is used to build a profile of a person that ultimately will be able to accurately predict the color of their next bowel movement.
If a man is interested in non-GMO foods advertising and “news” stories will be tailored to inform him of grocers who sell organics and about news from “approved” outlets with stories written on the topic. Most of the time, this will be insidious advertising and ads disguised as information.
“Hello, audience. We’re going to pitch you on becoming full-fledged obsessed consumers, as if there is no other worthy goal in life—and then we’re going to profile you from top to bottom, to find out exactly what kind of obsessed consumer you are, so we can hit you and trigger you with information that uniquely stimulates your adrenal glands…”
The Utah Data Center is designed to store exabytes of information on “all forms of communication, including emails, cell phone calls, and Internet searches, as well as all types of personal data trails—parking receipts, travel itineraries, and bookstore purchases”
As another example: Okay, we know you are interested in traditional gender roles. We ( the information managers like Facebook and Google) will now to find news stories and customize the information you get to read online in order to cause you to doubt the validity of your beliefs. The ultimate goal is to slowly but steadily move you away from believing in traditional gender roles to believing in militant feminism without you realizing what we have done.
This type of information management is even more insidious than outright censorship, as it will be designed to steer everyone towards what the controllers of society want us to think and buy, no matter how far from the ideal consumer and fellow traveler we may be.
Think of it as a game of Plinko on The Price is Right, in which all chips ultimately fall into the “perfect, braindead consumer” slot at the bottom of the maze. The social engineers’ dream is a world of nothing but sexless consumers who perform mindless work in meaningless jobs, whose only outlets for pleasure are shopping and eating out and other State-approved activities.
Think that’s hyperbole? Travel around the world for six months to a year, then come back to the United States and tell me what you think.
Little Information Bubbles Merge Into Big Information Bubbles We become what we are repeatedly exposed to, which is why a war is on for your mind
Once we have you believing a certain way or questioning your established beliefs, the key comes when it is time to steer public perception one way or the other. This is where the “rubber meets the road” in the realm of managing the populace like so many sheeple.
BUT when a Big One comes along, like the 2016 national election in the US, the separate tunes come together and ring as one. Then the overriding need to extend Globalism’s goals (in the person of Hillary Clinton) blot out every other priority. Then the major media twist whatever they need to twist. Then it’s the same bubble for everyone.
Soon, just like the mainstream media on television and in print, everything you see online will be directed at making you think, behave and vote a certain way. The micromanagement and control of information just hasn’t become that sophisticated – yet.
Obama already hinted that only “official” information should be linked up by the corporate interests of Facebook, Google, etc. Look for Hillary to implement that idea with an iron fist if she is whisked into the Oval Office . An Internet security “crisis” will likely be engineered in the near future in which—you guessed it—Big Daddy Government needs to step in and take control of the web. From there on out we will be back to corporate-government propaganda instead of the Libertarian’s dream the current iteration of the Internet is.
So, the awakening we have seen from the brainwashing of the corporate media will be a temporary one if the elite have anything to do with it. The groundwork of this new, Socialist system of micromanaging information is already being laid. You already see it every time you do a search.
Someday soon the only information we’ll be able to find online will be from sources the corporate-government complex approves of. Of course, there will be renegades and rebels like us who resist, but most of the braindead sheeple out there will go along to get along just as has been happening since time immemorial.
Our options will be to get off the grid or to move to a new Internet. Neither move will be peacefully tolerated by the powers that be.

The great democratic experiment is over and our overlords (i.e. George Soros) rule America from behind the scenes. If Clinton becomes president, Soros will be the de facto president. 
In the furtherance of this goal, voter fraud is rampant. Here is what is taking place in my home county. It is representative of what is happening across the country. 
On Saturday, I am interviewing a Texas elector, Ken Clark, from the electoral college. He told me that when Bush was opposed by Gore, that he received enormous pressure to change his vote in the days leading up to the electors vote including being contacted at his hotel prior to the vote. This is already happening with some of the Arizona electors. It is going to happen all across the country. Massive Voter Fraud in Arizona As I have reported, and it bears repeating, a very reliable political source in Arizona has reported to me that an elector has been offered an inducement (bribe) to vote for Clinton instead of Trump. Details are still emerging and I expect to get more in the immediate few days following the election. I can say now, that the inducements included payment to a phony shell corporation in an off shore account. It should also be noted that Arizona is on the list of 16 states to be using George Soros’ voting machines. The following is an example of this impropriety at work. I received this communication last week from a relative of an employee of the Maricopa County Clerk’s office that is in charge of local elections in the Phoenix area. Dear Dave, I have a relative who works in elections for the county. What they have told me is scary beyond belief. During the primary election as you will remember, people lined up for hours to vote because our illustrious leader Helen Purcell purposely limited the amount of voting locations. My relative was a witness to the manner in which early ballots were transferred for counting. They saw an individual by themself transfer the votes. The ballots were in a cardboard box and were open? Anyone could tamper with the vote. I am telling that the same thing is going on again right here in Maricopa County. This practice which is illegal will allow the Clinton to commit massive voter fraud against Donald Trump. Some of the new voting machines have been tested and they revert to a vote for Clinton when a Republic straight line ticket is entered. Ballots that were mixed between the parties but had Trump as the choice were tagged as unreadable and if the test was real, would have been thrown out based on user error. The top people here know what is going on and they are not reporting this as of October 17, 2016. At County elections there is a very intimidating feel. Everyone is afraid to speak out. And I almost forgot that Sheriff Joe’s trial run showed the same pattern as Trump. They want him out too. Well this unbelievable account got attention from Phoenix TV station, News Channel 3. On October 26, at 605 AM, the station ran a very close version of the story described above. I was stunned as I saw the report parallel the email I received (above). However, at the end of the report, they let a Democratic Party Official, who looked like a heroin addict claim that similar problems with the voting machines were also found for Hillary Clinton. Yet, not one example was offered of this Democratic claim on the TV report, just her word in an example of very shoddy journalism. Speaking of the massive fraud going on in Maricopa County, I want to reiterate what I reported on 10/26/2016. A postal employee told me that they had already processed 2.7 million votes from early balloting. There are only 3.4 million registered voters in all of Arizona. Are we supposed to believe that 80% of Arizona’s residents are voting? Are supposed to believe that this unbelievably high percentage of Arizona voters are voting by mail in ballot? These numbers defy logic. This is a clear case of ballot stuffing. Should we be surprised by the events in Arizona? The head of Maricopa County elections, Helen Purcell, oversaw a voting fiasco in the last election,the Republican primary election. Yet, she was re-elected by the must suspicious and narrowest of margins. Also in Maricopa County, County DA, Bill Montgomery has filed an election tampering charges against George Soros for his personal donation of millions of dollars that were used to support Democratic prosecutors. In other words, when the voter fraud is unveiled and exposed for all to see, Soros will see that nobody gets prosecuted for the bad acts being committed by the Democrats in the same manner in which Comey and Lynch let Hillary Clinton avoid the per walk. The Purpose of the Polls The polls conducted by mainstream media outlets are shoddy and the include small sample sizes and a disproportionate number of Democrats that are surveyed. The purpose is to create the perception that Trump cannot win and when the voter fraud kicks in, as it is now, nobody will question the fraud because they have been falsely conditioned that Trump will lose. Further, the polls are designed to discourage Trump supporters from voting and since their man cannot win, why not just stay home and have a beer? Here is a summary of a recent independent poll in which Trump was found to be leading 67%-19% over Clinton. 
When the fraud is cover and Clinton has won, Americans will have to make a choice on how to respond. PLEASE SUBSCRIBE TO OUR YOUTUBE CHANNEL AND DON’T FORGET TO “LIKE” US

60876,Qatar emir says open to dialogue to resolve Gulf crisis,"BOGOR, Indonesia (Reuters) - Qatar is  open to dialogue  in resolving a dispute that has seen the Gulf state isolated from its Arab neighbors, its emir said during a visit to Indonesia on Wednesday. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain cut diplomatic and trade ties with Qatar on June 5, accusing it of financing terrorism and maintaining too close of ties to their arch-rival Iran. Doha denies the charges. Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani said he discussed the issue with President Joko Widodo of Indonesia, which has the world s largest population of Muslims and has close ties to the Arab world.          We conveyed...that Qatar is ready to conduct a dialogue to solve the problem as we already know that no one will win,  Thani told reporters after meeting with Widodo at the state palace in Bogor, outside the capital of Jakarta.  We are all brothers and suffering because of this crisis,  he added. President Widodo did not publicly address the dispute. The leader of the world s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas also visited Malaysia - another Muslim-majority nation - and Singapore this week.     Saudi and other Arab nations have made a list of 13 wide-ranging demands of Qatar, including closing down the Al Jazeera television network and curbing ties with Iran.  Kuwait and top United States officials have attempted to mediate between the parties, but there is little sign that the crisis will be resolved soon. ",0
58198,Greece moves asylum-seekers from Lesbos to mainland,"PIRAEUS (Reuters) - Greek authorities on Thursday moved a few hundred asylum-seekers from the island of Lesbos to the mainland in an effort to ease overcrowding in its camps. Thousands of asylum-seekers have become stranded on Lesbos and four other islands close to Turkey since the European Union agreed a deal with Ankara in March 2016 to shut down the route through Greece.  I came to heaven from hell,  said 30-year old Mohammad Firuz, who lived for two months in a state-run camp in Lesbos. Firuz was among 300 people, many of them women and children, aboard a ferry that reached the port of Piraeus early on Thursday morning. The asylum seekers would be taken to camps and apartments in the mainland, authorities said. Lesbos is now hosting some 8,500 asylum-seekers, nearly three times the capacity of state-run facilities.    Violence often breaks out, mainly over delays in asylum procedures and poor living standards. Lesbos residents went on strike earlier this month to protest against European policies they say have turned it into a  prison  for migrants and refugees. ",0
49541,"In Ethiopia, Obama seeks progress on peace, security in East Africa","ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia —President Obama convened a meeting with the leaders of several East African nations and the African Union on Monday in an effort to address the worsening situation in South Sudan, even as he met with Ethiopia’s prime minister to discuss how to strengthen human rights and democratic institutions here.

With no resolution in sight for the ongoing conflict in South Sudan, Obama brought together top officials from Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, Sudan and the A.U. to chart out a strategy in the event that the latest round of peace talks fail.

African nations, led by Ethiopia, have been trying to broker a peace in South Sudan through the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), a regional body, and are almost ready to present a possible compromise to the warring parties. The two sides will have until Aug. 17 to respond to the proposal, but administration officials have little expectation that they will accept it.

On Monday, Obama praised the regional leaders for showing “extraordinary leadership in trying to address the continuing situation in South Sudan.” The group included Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, African Union Chairperson Dlamini Zuma and Sudan’s minister of foreign affairs, Ibrahim Ghandour.

“This gives me and the U.S. delegation an opportunity to learn from them what progress has been made, where there appears to be continued roadblocks and how we can partner with them to make progress,” Obama said. “Our hope is that we can actually bring about the kind of peace that the people of South Sudan so desperately need.”

The question of South Sudan — a nation that the United States helped bring into existence in 2011 after years of effort by both the George W. Bush and Obama administrations — has vexed American policymakers for years.

In December 2013, South Sudan President Salva Kiir accused Riek Machar, who had served as his vice president, of attempting a coup d’etat. The two had been longtime political rivals from different ethnic groups — Kiir is Dinka, Machar is a Nuer — who had come together to form a government when the country was first created.

While tribal differences have helped fuel the conflict, the war has been largely focused on control of the nation’s oil fields, South Sudan’s primary source of revenue.

Princeton Lyman, U.S. special envoy for Sudan and South Sudan from 2011 to 2013, noted that when he first took over as envoy, the United States had spent $10 billion on peacekeeping and other assistance for the two nations, “and that was four years ago… This is a big investment,” he added.

At this point, more than 2.5 million people are facing food shortages, while roughly 1.5 million are displaced from their homes. An additional 520,000 South Sudanese have fled across the border into neighboring countries, including Ethiopia.

The conflict also poses a major economic problem for Kenya, which had major investments in South Sudan before the fighting broke out. The LAPSSET Corridor project was aimed at transporting oil from South Sudan to the Kenyan port of Lamu, and according to E.J. Hogendoorn, deputy program director for Africa at the International Crisis Group, the planned transportation and infrastructure development could have been an “engine of development"" for many parts of East Africa. ""Unfortunately, of course, that’s on hold because of the war,” he said.

While Obama spent part of the afternoon addressing a regional conflict in Africa, he devoted the rest of the day to strengthening ties with Ethiopia, whose alliance with the United States dates back more than a century. But the current government has come under sharp criticism for its treatment of political opponents and journalists.

Obama is the first sitting U.S. president to visit Ethiopia.

In a news conference Monday afternoon, both Obama and Hailemariam said they had a frank discussion about Ethiopia's human rights practices and the need for improvement. Ethiopia is Africa’s number two jailer of journalists, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, and its ruling party won 100 percent of the seats in May’s parliamentary elections.

White House national security adviser Susan Rice, asked last week whether she considered Ethiopia a democracy, replied, with irony: “One hundred percent.”

But during the news conference Obama twice referred to the Ethiopian government as “democratically elected.”

“I don’t bite my tongue,” Obama said of raising concerns on these issues with Ethiopia. “But I do so from a position of respect.”

Hailemariam, for his part, said, “Our commitment to democracy is real, not skin deep.”

But he added later that people could not expect sweeping reforms given the fact that military rule ended just a couple of decades ago. “Something has to be understood: This is a fledgling democracy.”

The two leaders also discussed their collaboration on counterterrorism, an area in which Ethiopia has been an active leader. The White House announced Monday it will “work with Congress to provide approximately $465 million” this year in new training, equipment and capacity-building aid to its African allies.

The administration also said it would provide at least $40 million in assistance this fiscal year to combat violent extremism in East Africa. The money is intended to foster collaboration among security forces, law enforcement, government officials, community leaders and members of civil society, officials said.

Obama praised Ethiopia’s work to curb extremist activity but noted that its government had labeled some opposition groups as posing a greater threat than U.S. intelligence would indicate. “Our intelligence indicates while they may oppose the government, they have not tipped into terrorism,” he said.

The United States provides more than $600 million in assistance to Ethiopia annually. The vast bulk of that — $490 million — comes from the U.S. Agency for International Development, while the rest is largely security-related. Last fiscal year, nearly $200 million went to health programs, while $163 million went to humanitarian aid.

Obama said Ethiopia “has proven itself a global leader” on development and over the past 15 years “has lifted millions of people out of poverty.”

“To many people around the world, their image of Ethiopia remains stuck in the past, remembering drought and famine,” he said.

The two leaders appeared to have a friendly rapport throughout the news conference. Hailemariam described his country as scoring a series of firsts: Along with being “the cradle of mankind,” he said, “Ethiopia is the birthplace of coffee.” That elicited a smile from Obama.

Obama said he was impressed by the Ethiopian’s unusual pets. “I had a chance to see the famous lions that live on the grounds,"" he said. ""I’m considering getting some for the White House.” But he conceded that before he did that, “I’ll have to make sure my dogs are safe.”",0
6013,German coalition candidates want 40 percent cut in CO2 emissions by 2020: sources,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German parties in exploratory talks on forming a coalition government agreed on Thursday to stick to climate goals that envisage cutting CO2 emissions to 40 percent of 1990 levels by 2020, sources said. But negotiators from Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives, the Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) did not debate concrete measures such as a possible exit from coal-based energy production, the sources added. One source added that the initial agreement still needs to be approved by party leaders at later meetings. Germany needs to implement additional measures to reach the 40 percent emissions reduction goal otherwise it will only achieve a 32 percent cut in CO2 emissions. ",0
33900,DISGUSTING VIDEOS Show Joe Biden Groping Little Girls…Watch Girls Elbow Biden To Keep His Hands Off Their Breasts,"Joe Biden didn t earn his nickname  Creepy Joe  or  Creepy Uncle Joe  for his good behavior. Sadly,  Creepy Joe  earned his nickname after he was caught numerous times groping women and young girls on camera. Of course, the media gives Joe Biden a pass, because he s a Democrat, and if there s anything we ve learned over the past 4 decades, it s that high-profile members of the Democrat Party, like accused rapist Bill Clinton, can t be held accountable for their  playful  sexual advances towards women, and in the especially creepy Joe Biden s case, young girls.The first girl is a niece of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky (R). The girl with the sharp elbow is apparently a relative of freshman Senator Steve Daines of Montana (R).An enlarged image from C-SPAN shows Biden s hand sliding over the chest of McConnell s niece.Another incident shows Biden s right hand sliding down a girl s shoulder and then his fingers creep over toward her breast [at about the 4:20 mark]. The girl elbowed Biden and stepped away from him, but Biden grabbed her and put his right hand back over her breast.Watch, as Joe Biden moves his hand down on this little girl s breast. You can see her elbowing him, as he s clearly making her uncomfortable. But Creepy Joe persists Here s a compilation of Joe Biden s sexual assaults in plain view of the camera and family members:One of the best videos in the collection of Creepy Joe moments caught on tape was when the camera caught the former Senator Jeff Sessions actually SLAPPING Joe s hands when he attempts to grab ahold of Sessions granddaughter. Watch:In another incident from that day, Biden is meeting Colorado Senator Cory Gardner and his wife and 11-year-old daughter. The daughter puts herself on the other side of Biden from her father. Biden reaches out to shake her hand and tires to pull her toward him such that the resisting girl stumbles in her heels. Biden then asks her to hold the Bible for the swearing-in of her father to get her next to him so he could fondle her. Biden drags her over by the arm and positions her close to him with both hands on her. Biden hugs her with his right arm after the ceremonial swearing-in, pulling her hip to his crotch. Biden then holds the girl near him for the family photo session and keeps his left arm around her waist during the photos. Biden finishes by leaning over and whispering in her ear.Note: Watch Biden s hand beginning at the 1:32 mark. He actually rotates his hand up to touch the side of the 11-year-old girl s breast.Via: Gateway Pundit",1
23605,"VANISHED: FBI FILES Related To Mysterious “Suicide” Death Of Hillary’s Trusted WH Counsel, Vince Foster DISAPPEAR From National Archives","Corruption is nothing new for Hillary and Bill. What is truly stunning is the mountain of evidence that clearly shows their criminal behavior has been going on for decades How did documents describing Hillary Clinton s role in the death of White House counsel Vince Foster vanish?Foster is believed to have shot himself with a .38 caliber revolver at Fort Marcy Park along the Potomac River on July 20, 1993From NewsMax April 4, 2001. Vince Foster s Gun  Serial Number Searched Before DeathWhen Vince Foster was found dead from an apparent gunshot wound to the head in 1993, the government was quick to write off the death as a suicide.That sat well with Bill Clinton and Vince s closest confidante, Hillary Rodham Clinton.For years, detail after detail emerged questioning the official ruling.Significant questions were raised about the unusual gun   a .38 Colt revolver made from the parts of three guns with two serial numbers   found conveniently in Vince s hand.The Park Police said one of the serial numbers indicated the gun was vintage 1913   and had no pedigree.Foster family members insisted neither Foster nor his father ever owned the old revolver.Recently, a NewsMax.com reader named Craig Brinkley contacted us.Curious about the gun, Brinkley had filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the FBI, asking details of requests on the gun s serial numbers with the NCIC   the National Crime Information Center.The NCIC keeps records of all law enforcment inquiries of serial numbers.On March 23, 2001, the FBI responded to Brinkley s request.Serial number 356555, one of the numbers on the gun, was never searched, not by the FBI, the Park Police or by that  investigation  by Ken Starr.Serial number 355055 was found on the frame of the gun. Brinkley believes that was the gun s real nnumber.That number was indeed searched by the Park Police, on the evening of Foster s death, more exactly at 22:45 EDT on July 20, 1993.Interestingly, searches were conducted on the same serial number no fewer than three times earlier that year, before Foster s death, on March 3, March 7 and April 29.Was someone checking to see that this gun had a  clean  predigree and was untraceable?We called Marilyn Walton at the FBI s Access Integrity Unit. She told us that the government does not disclose which law enforcement agencies requested a trace on the serial number. She said it could have been made by local or federal agencies who have access to the NCIC computer.She noted that serial numbers are often duplicated, and usually when a request is made, it includes additional information, such as the gun s make and model.In all four cases no such information was entered, just the number. Walton added that many guns share similar serial numbers.Is it a coincidence that in the year of Foster s death, four searches were conducted on the serial number found on the old gun   none ever before or after? Two former FBI agents involved in the investigation tell Daily Mail Online they issued reports linking Hillary s tirade to Foster s suicideIn interviewing Clinton White House aides and Foster s friends and family, the FBI found that a week before Foster s death, Hillary held a meeting at the White House with Foster and other top aides to discuss her proposed health care legislation.Hillary angrily disagreed with a legal objection Foster raised at the meeting and ridiculed him in front of his peers, former FBI agent Coy Copeland and former FBI supervisory agent Jim Clemente told me. Copeland was Starr s senior investigator and read the reports of other agents working for Starr.During the White House meeting, Hillary continued to humiliate Foster mercilessly, according to both former FBI agents, who spoke about the investigation for the first time. Hillary put him down really, really bad in a pretty good-size meeting,  Copeland says.  She told him he didn t get the picture, and he would always be a little hick town lawyer who was obviously not ready for the big time. Indeed, Hillary went so far as to blame Foster for all the Clintons  problems and to accuse him of failing them, according to Clemente, who was also assigned by the FBI to the Starr investigation and who probed the circumstances surrounding Foster s suicide. Foster was profoundly depressed, but Hillary lambasting him was the final straw because she publicly embarrassed him in front of others,  says Clemente. Hillary blamed him for failed nominations, claimed he had not vetted them properly, and said in front of his White House colleagues,  You re not protecting us  and  You have failed us,  Clemente says.  That was the final blow. After the White House meeting, Foster s behavior changed dramatically, the FBI agents found. Those who knew him said his voice sounded strained, he became withdrawn and preoccupied, and his sense of humor vanished. At times, Foster teared up. He talked of feeling trapped.On Tuesday, July 13, 1993, while having dinner with his wife Lisa, Foster broke down and began to cry. He said he was considering resigning.Archived material related to the case, housed at National Archives in College Park, Md. were examined by the author to no availAfter filing a Freedom of Information request, it was determined that the agents  reported have gone missing FBI agents  reports of interviews documenting that Hillary Clinton s stinging humiliation of her friend and mentor Vince Foster in front of White House aides triggered his suicide a week later are missing from where they should be filed at the National Archives, Daily Mail Online has learned exclusively.On two separate occasions, this author visited the National Archives and Records Service in College Park, Md., to review the reports generated by FBI agents assigned to investigate the 1993 death of Bill Clinton s deputy White House counsel.On the first visit, archivist David Paynter provided the box of records that he said contained the FBI reports of interviews conducted by FBI agents on Foster s death.On a second visit, archivist James Mathis provided what he said were those same documents.While the box contained dozens of FBI reports concerning Foster s death   including interviews with the medical examiner, U.S. Park Police officers, and White House aides about the contents of Foster s office   the reports on Hillary Clinton s role in his death were absent.After filing a Freedom of Information request with the National Archives, Martha Murphy, the archives  public liaison, reported that she directed a senior archivist to conduct a more thorough review of the relevant FBI files, including those that had not been previously made public in response to FOIA requests. He examined all eight boxes but found no interviews by any investigator that detail either a meeting between Hillary Clinton and Vince Foster or the effects of a meeting between Hillary Clinton and Vince Foster on Vince Foster s state of mind,  Murphy reported in an email. We did not limit ourselves to interviews by the two individuals [FBI agents] you mention. While Murphy said the archives searched for  the records that would be responsive to your request  and concluded that they could not be found, when asked for comment, John Valceanu, the archives  director of communications and marketing, said,  We do not agree with your conclusion that the records you requested are missing from the National Archives simply because we were unable to locate any responsive records in response to your request. While confirming that the records could not be located, Valceanu held out the possibility that the FBI interviews were not filed where they should have been and were somewhere else in the more than 3,000 boxes of records amounting to 7.5 million pages generated by the Starr investigation.This is not the first time documents related to the Clintons have apparently vanished from the National Archive.In March 2009, the archives found that an external hard drive from the Bill Clinton White House containing confidential documents was missing.When it could not be located, the inspector general s office announced that it had opened a criminal investigation.Offering a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to recovery of the hard drive, the archives asked that tips be reported to the Secret Service. At the time, the archives said it had a backup drive.Via: Daily Mail ",1
55335,"Clinton Camp Claims Media Was Pro-Trump, Blames Them For ‘Devastating’ Loss | EndingFed News Network","Email Print A top member of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign told Clinton’s top supporters Thursday her defeat was “the most devastating loss in the history of American politics,” while campaign chairman John Podesta said the defeat was due to a pro-Donald Trump bias in the media. The remarks were made during a conference call between Clinton’s shell-shocked campaign team and several backers of Clinton’s campaign, such as donor J.B. Pritzker, Ready PAC co-founder Allida Black, and political strategist Maria Cardona. The contents of the private call were reported by The Hill , which spoke to one of the Clinton backers on the call. Clinton campaign spokesman Jennifer Palmieri didn’t mince words in describing how brutal Clinton’s upset defeat was, according to The Hill. “Thirty-six hours after the most devastating loss in the history of American politics, we’re looking at a white board right now with lots of ideas,” said Palmieri said. “We’re sort of figuring out what we need to do this week, and what we need Democrats to do in the next two months ahead of the inaugural.” Other aides, meanwhile, tried to shift blame for the shocking defeat away from the campaign and onto the media. “The media always covered her as the person who would be president and therefore tried to eviscerate her before the election, but covered Trump who was someone who was entertaining and sort of gave him a pass,” said Podesta. “We need to reflect and analyze that and put our voices forward.” Podesta also pointed a finger at FBI Director James Comey, who resurrected the matter of Clinton’s private email server in the final weekend. Podesta said the “dominance of the way [the media] covered the emails” caused them to drown out issues like Trump’s income taxes or his alleged links to Russia. The campaign’s explanations apparently didn’t do much to remedy the agony of defeat. Black began crying during the call, according to The Hill.

49835,Tyranny Of 9/11: The Building Blocks Of The American Police State From A-Z," No one man can terrorize a whole nation unless we are all his accomplices.    Edward R. MurrowJohn W. Whitehead Huffington PostWe ve walked a strange and harrowing road since September 11, 2001, littered with the debris of our once-vaunted liberties.Over the past 15 years, we have gone from a nation that took great pride in being a model of a representative democracy to being a model of how to persuade the citizenry to march in lockstep with a police state.What began with the passage of the USA Patriot Act in October 2001 has snowballed into the eradication of every vital safeguard against government overreach, corruption and abuse.This is not freedom. This is a jail cell. Set against a backdrop of government surveillance, militarized police, SWAT team raids, asset forfeiture, eminent domain, overcriminalization, armed surveillance drones, whole body scanners, stop and frisk searches, roving VIPR raids and the like all of which have been sanctioned by Congress, the White House and the courts our constitutional freedoms have been steadily chipped away at, undermined, eroded, whittled down, and generally discarded.Our losses are mounting with every passing day.Free speech, the right to protest, the right to challenge government wrongdoing, due process, a presumption of innocence, the right to self-defense, accountability and transparency in government, privacy, press, sovereignty, assembly, bodily integrity, representative government: all of these and more have become casualties in the government s war on the American people, a war that has grown more pronounced since 9/11.Since the towers fell on 9/11, the American people have been treated like enemy combatants, to be spied on, tracked, scanned, frisked, searched, subjected to all manner of intrusions, intimidated, invaded, raided, manhandled, censored, silenced, shot at, locked up, and denied due process.In allowing ourselves to be distracted by terror drills, foreign wars, color-coded warnings, underwear bombers and other carefully constructed exercises in propaganda, sleight of hand, and obfuscation, we failed to recognize that the true enemy to freedom was lurking among us all the while.Indeed, the U.S. government now poses a greater threat to our freedoms than any terrorist, extremist or foreign entity ever could. Here s an A-to-Z primer to spell out exactly what government tyranny means post 9/11.A is for the AMERICAN POLICE STATE.B is for our battered BILL OF RIGHTS.C is for CIVIL ASSET FORFEITURE, a diabolical governmental scheme to deprive Americans of their liberties, namely, the right to property.D is for DRONES, weaponized, equipped with lasers, tasers and scanning devices, and aimed at  we the people. E is for ELECTRONIC CONCENTRATION CAMP in which all citizens are suspects, their activities monitored and regulated, their movements tracked, their communications spied upon, and their lives, liberties and pursuit of happiness dependent on the government s say-so.F is for FUSION CENTERS, which serve as a clearinghouse for information shared between state, local and federal agencies. These fusion centers can constantly monitor our communications, everything from our internet activity and web searches to text messages, phone calls and emails.G is for GRENADE LAUNCHERS and GLOBAL POLICE. Take small-town police forces, equip them with enough firepower to render any citizen resistance futile, and then enlist them to be part of the United Nations  Strong Cities Network program, and you not only have a standing army that can operate beyond the reach of the Constitution, but one that is part of a global police force.H is for HOLLOW-POINT BULLETS. The government s efforts to militarize and weaponize its agencies and employees is reaching epic proportions, with federal agencies as varied as the Department of Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration stockpiling millions of lethal hollow-point bullets.I is for the INTERNET OF THINGS. This  connected  industry propels us closer to a future where police agencies apprehend virtually anyone if the government  thinks  they may commit a crime, driverless cars populate the highways, and a person s biometrics are constantly scanned and used to track their movements, target them for advertising, and keep them under perpetual surveillance.J is for JAILING FOR PROFIT. Having outsourced their inmate population to private prisons run by private corporations, this profit-driven form of mass punishment has given rise to a $70 billion private prison industry that relies on the complicity of state governments to keep their privately run prisons full by jailing large numbers of Americans for inane crimes.K is for KENTUCKY V. KING, a ruling that opens the door to warrantless police raids, leaving Americans with little real protection in the face of all manner of abuses by law enforcement officials.L is for LICENSE PLATE READERS, which enable law enforcement to track the whereabouts of vehicles, and their occupants, all across the country.M is for MAIN CORE, the U.S. government s database of 8 million or more names and information on Americans considered  threats  to the nation who should be rounded up in times of national emergency or under martial law.N is for NO-KNOCK RAIDS. More than 80,000 of these paramilitary raids are carried out every year more than 200 SWAT team raids every day and all in the pursuit of someone merely suspected of a crime, usually possession of some small amount of drugs.O is for OVERCRIMINALIZATION, which has resulted in an uptick in Americans being arrested and jailed for such absurd  violations  as letting their kids play at a park unsupervised, collecting rainwater and snow runoff on their own property, growing vegetables in their yard, and holding Bible studies in their living room.P is for PATHOCRACY and PRECRIME, tyranny at the hands of a psychopathic government. Couple that with the government s burgeoning precrime programs, and anyone seen as opposing the government whether they re Left, Right or somewhere in between becomes a potential extremist.Q is for QUALIFIED IMMUNITY, which allows officers to walk away without paying a dime for their wrongdoing.R is for ROADSIDE STRIP SEARCHES and BLOOD DRAWS. The courts have increasingly erred on the side of giving government officials especially the police vast discretion in carrying out strip searches, blood draws and even anal probes for a broad range of violations, no matter how minor the offense.S is for the SURVEILLANCE STATE. On any given day, the average American going about his daily business will be monitored, surveilled, spied on and tracked in more than 20 different ways, by both government and corporate eyes and ears.T is for TASERS and other nonlethal weapons, which enable police to aggress with the push of a button, making the potential for overblown confrontations over minor incidents that much more likely.U is for UNARMED CITIZENS SHOT BY POLICE. No longer is it unusual to hear about incidents in which police shoot unarmed individuals first and ask questions later, often attributed to a fear for their safety.V is for VIPR SQUADS, which are tasked with carrying out so-called  soft target  security inspections whenever and wherever the government deems appropriate, at random times and places, and without needing the justification of a particular threat.W is for WHOLE-BODY SCANNERS. Using either x-ray radiation or radio waves,scanning devices and government mobile units are being used not only to  see  through your clothes but to spy on you within the privacy of your home.X is for X-KEYSCORE. One of the many spying programs carried out by the NSA that targets every person in the United States who uses a computer or phone.Y is for YOU-NESS. Facial recognition software promises to create a society in which you can be tracked based on your face, mannerisms, social media and  you-ness. Z is for ZERO TOLERANCE, in which young people are increasingly viewed as suspects and treated as criminals by school officials and law enforcement alike, often for engaging in little more than childish behavior. The lesson being taught to our youngest and most impressionable citizens is this: in the American police state, you re either a prisoner (shackled, controlled, monitored, ordered about, limited in what you can do and say, your life not your own) or a prison bureaucrat (politician, police officer, judge, jailer, spy, profiteer, etc.).As I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, the reality we must come to terms with is that in the post-9/11 America we live in today, the government does whatever it wants, freedom be damned.The choices before us are straight-forward.We can live in the past, dwell on what freedoms we used to enjoy and shrug helplessly at the destruction of our liberties.We can immerse ourselves in the present, allowing ourselves to be utterly distracted by the glut of entertainment news and ever-changing headlines so that we fail to pay attention to or do anything about the government s ongoing power-grabs.We can hang our hopes on the future, believing against all odds that someone or something whether it be a politician, a movement, or a religious savior will save us from inevitable ruin.Or we can start right away by instituting changes at the local level, holding our government officials accountable to the rule of law, and resurrecting the Constitution, recognizing that if we fail to do so and instead follow our current trajectory, the picture of the future will be closer to what George Orwell likened to  a boot stamping on a human face forever.

58440,Cook these six vegetables for even greater health benefits,"Cook these six vegetables for even greater health benefits 
  raw food , cooking , vegetables (NaturalNews) ""To cook or not to cook?"" has been a topic of heated debate among some health food advocates. Raw food junkies claim that eating foods in their most natural state is the answer to all our issues and diseases, cancer included. They believe that cooking destroys essential vitamins, live enzymes and antioxidants vital to our health.While nobody will dispute the fact that adding more raw, organic fruits and vegetables to our diet is essential for overall health and well-being, going raw all the way isn't always the best option either. A study published in the British Journal of Nutrition found that people who followed a strictly raw food diet had normal levels of vitamin A and beta-carotene, but low levels of the antioxidant lycopene. As reported by Scientific American , high lycopene levels have been associated with a lower risk of cancer and heart attacks. According to Rui Hai Liu, an associate professor of food science at Cornell University, lycopene may be an even more potent antioxidant than vitamin C .It seems that some vegetables need a little heat to release their plant goodness. Most plants have a tough cellular structure. Lightly cooking these food makes it easier for the body to break down the plant's thick cell walls, making nutrients more available for absorption .Read on to discover six foods that are healthier cooked. 1. Asparagus Lightly cooking asparagus spears makes it easier for the body to absorb cancer-fighting vitamins such as vitamin A, C and E, as well as folate. Furthermore, higher levels of antioxidants, ferulic acid in particular, have been reported when this vegetable is cooked. 2. Carrots Beta-carotene is the compound that gives carrots their vibrant orange color. The body converts beta-carotene to vitamin A, which is vital for vision, reproduction, bone growth and immune health.Carrots, however, are sturdy vegetables and don't give up their nutrients that quickly. To get the most out of your carrots, Researchers at the University of Arkansas advise that higher levels of beta-carotene are obtained when carrots are cooked. 3. Mushrooms According to Andrew Weil, M.D., mushrooms are indigestible when they are uncooked. He said that thoroughly heating them releases the nutrients they contain, including B vitamins, proteins and minerals, as well as compounds not found in other foods. 4. Pumpkin and other winter squash Not many people will eat raw pumpkin, unless it is put through a juicer , and that is just fine, since cooked pumpkin has been shown to be more nutritious. Just like carrots, pumpkins need a little heat to break down tougher cell walls and release their plant goodness. 5. Spinach Folate, vitamin C, niacin, riboflavin and potassium are more available in raw spinach. However, slightly cooking spinach increases the levels of vitamin A and E, fiber, zinc, thiamin, calcium, iron and protein – as well as essential carotenoids, such as beta-carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin. 6. Tomatoes While cooking tomatoes reduces vitamin C levels, it also makes lycopene more available to the body. As mentioned earlier, lycopene has been linked to a lower risk of cancer and heart attacks. Vitamin C is an abundant vitamin, so it is well worth the loss.As you can see, raw isn't necessarily always best. However, if you love tomato or spinach salads and can't stand them cooked, that doesn't mean you should stop eating them raw. Whether you enjoy your veggies raw or cooked, the most important thing is that you are eating them in the first place.  ",1
71754, U2’s Bono Has BRUTAL Words For Donald Trump (VIDEO),"While rock band U2 s Bono has had a career of being politically outspoken, his priorities have generally been focused   primarily on improving living conditions in underdeveloped countries. Heck, the liberal Bono even found common ground with George W. Bush. There s no common ground to be found with Donald Trump, though, who the U2 singer called  potentially the worst idea that every happened to America. In an interview with CBS This Morning, Bono gave credence to the idea of American exceptionalism, but he feels that Trump destroys that. In fact, Bono says, Trump could  destroy  the very idea of America: Look, America is like the best idea the world ever came up with,  Bono, whose real name is Paul David Hewson, told  CBS This Morning  in an interview broadcast Tuesday.  But Donald Trump is potentially the worst idea that ever happened to America. Potentially. Bono pointed to nations like Ireland and Great Britain as great countries but suggested that America is different because it s an idea, one that Trump is  trying to hijack. That idea is bound up in justice and equality for all   equality and justice for all, you know,  he continued.  I think he s hijacked the party. I think he s trying to hijack the idea of America. And I think it s bigger than all of us. I think it s   it s   this is really dangerous. Source: PoliticoHere s the video:Say what you want about the often controversial Bono, but he has seen the world and he s right. The idea of America, as a melting pot, as a place where with hard work, anyone can be a success, is not completely incompatible with Donald Trump s ideas. Trump is a xenophobe. He and his supporters want to turn our nation into a solitary island. That s never been what our nation is about.Featured image via Mark Sagliocco/Getty Images.",1

20718,Duterte berates Canada's Trudeau at end of Philippines summit,"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte attacked Canada’s Justin Trudeau at the end of a summit of Asian and Western nations for raising questions about his war on drugs, a topic skirted by other leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump. At the traditional news conference by the host nation at the end of the summit on Tuesday, Duterte was asked how he had responded to the Canadian prime minister raising the issue of human rights and extra-judicial killings in his anti-drugs drive. “I said I will not explain. It is a personal and official insult,” the Philippines president said in the course of a rambling answer, although he did not refer to Trudeau by name. “I only answer to the Filipino. I will not answer to any other bullshit, especially foreigners. Lay off.” Earlier in the day, Trudeau told a news conference that during his meeting with Duterte “the president was receptive to my comments and it was throughout a very cordial and positive exchange”. Human rights activists had been hoping that leaders at the summit, including Trump, would raise the issue of the thousands of users and small-time pushers killed in the campaign that was launched by Duterte after he took office in mid-2016. His government says the police act in self-defense during drug-busts, but critics say executions are taking place with no accountability. There was no pressure from Trump on the drugs war when he met Duterte on Monday and the U.S. president later said the two had a “great relationship”. A joint statement after the meeting only said the two sides “underscored that human rights and the dignity of human life are essential, and agreed to continue mainstreaming the human rights agenda in their national programs.” Duterte cursed Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, last year for raising concerns about the war on drugs and he subsequently declared that he was breaking ties with the United States, a close ally of the Philippines since World War Two. The relationship appears to have got back on track after the bonhomie between him and Trump. Trudeau also said that he raised the issue of the exodus of Rohingya during a meeting with Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi, another sensitive topic bypassed by most other leaders, although he did not mention the Muslim minority by name. “This is a tremendous concern to Canada and to many, many countries around the world,” he said. The government in mostly-Buddhist Myanmar regards the Rohingya as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and does not recognize the term. Over 600,000 Rohingya have fled to refugee camps in Bangladesh since military clearance operations were launched in response to attacks by Rohingya militants on Aug. 25.  The plight of the Rohingya has brought outrage from around the world and the United Nations has called the operations ethnic cleansing. There have been calls for democracy champion Suu Kyi to be stripped of the Nobel peace prize she won in 1991 because she has not condemned the military’s actions. Some countries in the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), particularly Muslim-majority Malaysia, have voiced strong concern over the issue recently. However, in keeping with ASEAN’s principle of non-interference in each others’ internal affairs, it appeared to have been put aside at the summit, which brought Southeast Asian nations together with the United States, Russia, Japan, China, India, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. Duterte reported that China had agreed at the summit to work on a code of conduct in the South China Sea with ASEAN nations to ease tensions over disputed claims to the busy and resource-rich waterway. The group also signed agreements on protecting migrant labor and fighting terrorism and cybercrime. Trump skipped the plenary session of the summit because of scheduling delays, but he said his marathon trip to Asia had been a “tremendous” success. He told reporters on Air Force One that he had delivered his prepared remarks during a lunch before the summit meeting.  Trump said at least $300 billion, possibly triple that figure, of deals had been agreed in the trip. He did not elaborate. “We’ve explained that the United States is open for trade but we want reciprocal, we want fair trade for the United States,” he said. Trade and concern about possible protectionism under Trump’s “America First” agenda have come up during his visit to the region, which included stops in Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam before concluding in the Philippines. After Trump left Manila, a group of Asia-Pacific nations pursuing a separate Beijing-backed trade deal that does not include the United States agreed to “intensify efforts” in 2018 to bring their negotiations to a conclusion. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) appeared to have been given new impetus at the summit by Trump’s withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement, to which China is not party. The two trade deals are not mutually exclusive. ASEAN is joined in the RCEP talks by China, India, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea. ",0

13438,Republicans ask Clinton Foundation to produce correspondence,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Republican National Committee asked the charity of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s family on Monday to produce all correspondence its staff had with the U.S. State Department while Clinton served as America’s most senior diplomat.  Clinton’s campaign to win the Nov. 8 presidential election has been dogged by criticism that donors to the Clinton Foundation may have expected special favors from the U.S. government in return. She says donors to the global charity receive no preferential treatment.     “The Clinton Foundation can play a vital role in filling important gaps in the public record by demonstrating its commitment to transparency and making public all correspondence its officials had with the State Department during Secretary Clinton’s tenure,” Reince Priebus, the RNC chairman, said in a letter to the foundation’s president, Donna Shalala.  The RNC provided a copy of the letter to reporters.      Spokesmen for Clinton and the foundation, which is known for its work to widen access to HIV medicines in developing countries, did not respond to a request for comment. Some emails have already emerged that show Clinton Foundation officials seeking meetings with Clinton and other diplomats on behalf of supporters who have made large donations to the foundation.  Foundation officials also sought other favors, including help with visa issues or urging the government to hire certain people, emails show. Spokesmen for Clinton have noted that in several cases the requests from foundation officials were unsuccessful. Thousands more emails from Clinton’s tenure are still in the process of being released as public records. Their release was delayed in part because of Clinton’s decision to use an unauthorized private email server for her work without informing record-keeping officials.  In his letter, Priebus said the foundation’s own records have “the unique ability” to establish whether donors received special treatment.     Clinton promised President Barack Obama that her family’s charities would annually disclose all their donors and seek prior approval from the State Department for any additional money given by foreign governments when Obama made her his most senior diplomat in 2009. The charities said last year they failed to comply with the promises, blaming oversights. The foundation has said it will no longer accept foreign or corporate funding for at least some of its work if Clinton is elected. Her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, will remain on the board. ",0
31062,U.S. top court denies Obama request to rehear major immigration case,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to rehear a bid to revive President Barack Obama’s plan to spare from deportation millions of immigrants in the country illegally, a case in which the justices split 4-4 in June. In a brief order, the court rejected the Obama administration’s long-shot request, meaning the justices’ June 23 decision is final. That ruling left in place lower court decisions blocking the plan, which Obama announced in 2014 but never went into effect. The high court remains one justice short following Antonin Scalia’s February death. The Democratic president’s plan was challenged in court by Republican-governed Texas and 25 other states that argued he overstepped the powers granted to him by the U.S. Constitution by infringing upon congressional authority. Obama acted unilaterally by executive action, bypassing the Republican-led Congress. “This is the latest setback to the president’s attempt to expand executive power and another victory for those who believe in the Constitution’s separation of powers and the rule of law,” Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said of the Supreme Court’s action on Monday. Obama’s plan was designed to let roughly 4 million people - those who have lived illegally in the United States at least since 2010, have no criminal record and have children who are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents - get into a program that shields them from deportation and supplies work permits. The administration in July asked the court to take a second look at the case once it had a full complement of nine justices. “The inability of the Supreme Court in this situation to reach a decision and put forward a ruling has a negative impact on millions of people in the United States,” White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters, calling on Senate Republicans to confirm a ninth justice. The administration’s immigration enforcement efforts, focusing on criminals, recent border-crossers and on people who pose a national security threat, will move forward, unaffected by the Supreme Court’s action, Earnest said. The Republican-led Senate, in a move with little precedent in U.S. history, has refused to consider Obama’s nominee to replace Scalia, federal appeals court judge Merrick Garland, saying Obama’s successor should make the appointment. “By continuing their historic, unprecedented obstruction of Chief Judge Merrick Garland’s nomination, Republicans are spreading gridlock and denying justice to the American people,” Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said. An estimated 11 million immigrants live in the United States illegally. ",0
40183,Comment on Useful Idiots for Islam by MomOfIV,"| January 15, 2016 at 6:00 am | Reply 
Slavery still exists in Saudi Arabia (as well as parts of Africa) today. But what is Saudi Arabia? For all practical purposes, it is Great Britain’s vassal state, run by a family of criminals whom we and Great Britain protect. Saudi Arabia is not even a nation-state in the modern sense of the term: The Royal Family there considers themselves to be owners of the land—as if it were their personal property—who allow others to live on it. (Churchill and others either set up Saudi Arabia or allowed it to become established in its current political structure. They also established the current national boundaries in the Middle East, leading, in part, to the present troubles). What kind of a religion is this that encourages all of the worst carnality of men? St. Thomas Aquinas tackled this matter head-on: He wrote that Mohammed sought out men as carnal as himself, and he encouraged his followers to do the same. (And they consider Jesus Our Lord to be a prophet, as if He would EVER condone their evil?!) Islam, like the New World Order manipulating it, is a BEAST SYSTEM. It is a criminal racket with a political ideology and structure, masquerading as a religion! WAKE UP, PEOPLE!",1
30514,Clinton email problem resurfaces as FBI announces review,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The FBI is investigating more emails as part of a probe into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email system, it said on Friday, in a new twist that could damage the Democratic candidate in the 2016 presidential race. Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey said in a letter to senior lawmakers that the agency would determine whether the additional emails contained classified information, adding that he did not know “how long it will take us to complete this additional work.” The announcement came as Clinton and Republican opponent Donald Trump enter the final stretch of campaigning ahead of the Nov. 8 election.  In a news conference late on Friday in Des Moines, Iowa, Clinton urged Comey to release more details about what the FBI was looking for in the newly discovered emails. She leads Trump in opinion polls after a bruising campaign in which she has struggled to convince voters that she is trustworthy and honest. Fresh revelations about her use of email are unlikely to assuage those concerns, and questions around the FBI investigation will now likely dog her in the coming days as she campaigns across battleground states. U.S. stocks immediately fell sharply on the news, but went on to partially recover. The FBI spent about a year investigating Clinton’s use of the unauthorized server at her home in Chappaqua, New York, while she was U.S. secretary of state after classified government secrets were found in some of her emails.  Comey said in July that while “there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.” Although Comey recommended no criminal charges be brought against Clinton, Trump has repeatedly said her email practices are criminal and should disqualify her for office. He seized on Friday’s development at rallies in Maine and New Hampshire. “This is the biggest political scandal since Watergate, and I’m sure it will be properly handled from this point forward,” Trump told a crowd in Lisbon, Maine. “We hope that all, all justice will be fully served,” he said. Supporters cheered his words and chanted, “Lock her up.” Clinton said she had learned of the newly discovered emails from news reports.  “I’m confident whatever they are will not change the conclusion reached in July,” she said. “That’s why it’s incumbent upon the FBI to tell us what’s going on.” Two sources close to the investigation said the latest emails were discovered not during an investigation into Clinton, but rather as part of a separate probe into Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. The FBI has been investigating illicit text messages allegedly sent from Weiner to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, and found the Clinton emails on a device related to that investigation, the sources said. Abedin told federal investigators in April that she used several email accounts for her work, including a Yahoo email, according to a summary of the interview released by the FBI in September. She said it was difficult to print from the State Department’s email system so she routinely forwarded documents to her private accounts when she needed to print them out, according to the summary.  Abedin announced her separation from Weiner in August after a sex scandal similar to an earlier incident that led him to resign from the U.S. Congress. Lawyers representing Abedin did not respond to questions sent by email on Friday. Weiner did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment, and he did not respond to phone calls. Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic strategist who had previously advised former President Bill Clinton but has no role with Hillary Clinton’s campaign, said the linking of Clinton’s email woes with Weiner’s sex scandals made it harder for her campaign to distinguish itself from Trump’s sex scandals. “The whole campaign is now smeared with sex, corruption and scandal,” he said. “Nobody remembers the beginning of something, they only remember the end. What are they going to remember? They’re all the same: sex, scandal, corruption, emails. People are going to have trouble sorting out all this information.” Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, said it was “extraordinary” for the FBI to release the letter so close to the end of a hotly contested election. “The Director owes it to the American people to immediately provide the full details of what he is now examining,” Podesta said in a statement. “We are confident this will not produce any conclusions different from the one the FBI reached in July.”  Clinton has repeatedly apologized for using the private email server in her home instead of a government email account for her work as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. She has said she did not knowingly send or receive classified information. While the FBI probe of new emails will likely prove a distraction to Clinton in the coming days, it was unclear what impact it would have when Americans go to the polls. Election experts say about 20 percent of ballots have already been cast, as more Americans vote by mail or go to the polls early. “A lot of concern about the emails has already been baked into this electoral cake I think,” said Linda Fowler, a professor of government at Dartmouth College. “They know she did it, they know it was inappropriate and, failing some sensational revelation on Nov. 6, it’s hard to see that it’s going to make that big a difference.” Still, Republican lawmakers, who are facing a difficult fight to keep their majorities in both the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives, leaped to condemn Clinton. House Speaker Paul Ryan reiterated his call that the Democratic nominee be barred from briefings involving classified information until the investigation is over. Reince Priebus, the head of the Republican National Committee, said the FBI’s decision to look into the emails shows “how serious this discovery must be.”    Clinton did not respond to reporters’ shouted questions about the news when she left her plane for a campaign stop in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. U.S. stocks declined in a volatile session on Friday but partially recovered from the sharp drop spurred by the FBI announcement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed the day down about 9 points, or .05 percent, while the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was unchanged on the day. The dollar also fell against major currencies.

34021,"Preparing to Invade: US Deploys Additional 2,500 Soldiers for ‘Syria and Iraq’","21st Century Wire says While the US media continues to lead the public up the garden path by allocating all of its coverage for Obamacare news, the US is quietly ramping-up its forces in the Middle East as the Pentagon quietly positions its assets on the ground in Syria   in preparation for the grand battle to  defeat ISIS. Besides the western media s near blackout of recent US Ranger and Marine deployments on the ground in Syria, what should also worry the public is how the amount of political pressure currently on the embattled Trump White House   might be influencing this Administration s desire to show  a win  militarily in Syria.Military officials spoke to Reuters this week, confirming that rapidly deployable forces in Kuwait are in fact in position as part of an operation to oust ISIS from Raqqa.Already, for months now, several hundred  Special Operations  troops have been embedded with local Kurdish forces.According to the Pentagon reports, at least 6,000 US troops (not including covert operations and private military contractors, possibly an additional 1,000 operatives) are currently operating in both Iraq and Syria.Watch this raw video of one regiment of US troops who arrived in Syria this week: How long until other US NATO allies also arrive with more troops and military assets in Syria?The big risk here could be that the rush to war might be ill-conceived, not to mention completely illegal under international law   considering the United States still refuses to open any dialogue with the sovereign nation state of Syria.In a recent article, 21WIRE s Patrick Henningsen has commented in detail already about the apparent lack of coordination and competing agenda between the US, Turkey, Syria and Russia in northern Syria, including the potential for in-fighting between Coalition forces and their proxies.Meanwhile, the US-led Coalition continues to impose punitive sanctions against Syria, while US allies continue to arm and support numerous radical Wahabi terrorist militant groups who are still destablizing Syria and terrorizing its residents.Expect more assets to be deployed in the coming days and weeks   and more silence from the media Army TimesWASHINGTON   The U.S. military is sending an additional 2,500 ground combat troops to a staging base in Kuwait from which they could be called upon to back up coalition forces battling the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.The deployment will include elements of the 82nd Airborne Division s 2nd Brigade Combat Team, which is based at Fort Bragg in North Carolina. About 1,700 soldiers from the same unit are overseas now, spread between Iraq and Kuwait. They re focused on the U.S.-led effort to train and assist the Iraqi troops doing much of the fighting against ISIS there.These new personnel, however, will be  postured there to do all things Mosul, Raqqa, all in between,  Army Lt. Gen. Joseph Anderson, the Army s deputy chief of staff for operations, told House lawmakers Wednesday. He was referring to the Islamic State s two main strongholds: Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria, major urban centers where U.S.-back allies are fighting a well entrenched enemy. So the whole brigade will now be forward,  Anderson said.( ) There are a number of options under consideration as the coalition looks for ways to accelerate the defeat of ISIS,  it says.  We continue to believe that the most effective way to achieve a lasting victory is to do it by, with and through our partner forces who have the greatest stake in the outcome. For operational security reasons, we will not discuss future deployments or contingency operational planning.

67301,DEM CANDIDATE #JonOssoff CAN’T EVEN VOTE In District He’s Running In…Lies About Where He Lives [Video],"Democrat Jon Ossoff said Tuesday that he believes voters in Georgia s sixth congressional district do not care that he does not live in the district he is running to represent, dismissing questions on his residency. Well, he did work for Georgia Rep. Hank Johnson for 5 years Johnson famously said the island of Guam would tip over but was reelected anyway. Details, meh Ossoff s residency has been a persistent problem for him during his special election campaign to fill Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price s vacant House seat.OSSOFF SAID HE  LIVES DOWN THE STREET  BUT IT TOOK A WASHINGTON FREE BEACON REPORTER OVER 2 HOURS TO WALK FROM OSSOFF S HOUSE TO THE 6TH DISTRICT HEADQUARTERS!The Georgia Democrat lives a two-hour walk away from the sixth district, so that his fianc e can walk to her medical school classes.The question of where he lives came up again when Ossoff appeared on MSNBC. Host Stephanie Ruhle asked why, in such a close race, Ossoff has not made a greater effort to address his residency outside of the district. Voters just aren t asking me this question,  Ossoff responded. Folks here in Georgia s sixth district care about how their representation is going to impact their daily lives,  he added.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9M5h99tq9c I grew up in this community. As you mentioned, I live a couple of miles down the road to support my fianc e while she finishes medical school,  Ossoff said.  I m running to serve my home town in Congress, and I want to make them proud. Ruhle pushed Ossoff on why he would not address the issue in such a tight race. Since the special election, where you were at 48.1 [percent], things have only moved to 48.8, with 50 million bucks under your belt. Voters care about a lot. If you look back on this and things are that tight, wouldn t you say to yourself, just get an apartment in the district?  Ruhle asked. If voters were raising that as a serious concern, Steph, maybe I would,  Ossoff said. But voters care about how policy and about how representation is going to impact their daily lives,  he continued.  They know I grew up in this community. They know I grew up in the sixth district. They know why I m a couple of miles south of the line. It s just not a major issue in the race. Because he lives outside of the district, Ossoff cannot vote for himself on Tuesday in his congressional bid against Republican Karen Handel.Via: WFB",1
58678,Driver charged with attempted murder over Australian vehicle attack,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - The man accused of deliberately plowing into Christmas shoppers on a busy street in the Australian city of Melbourne was charged on Saturday with 18 counts of attempted murder and one count of conduct endangering life. The Thursday incident was the second serious vehicle attack in Australia s second biggest city this year. Police said they had charged the man, former Afghanistan refugee Saeed Noori, after formally interviewing him about the attack that police had earlier described as a  deliberate act . Police have said Noori, 32, is known to have mental health problems and to use drugs and they did not believe the attack was terrorism-related. Police suspect Noori was behind the wheel of a white SUV when he deliberately sped up and drove into dozens of pedestrians crossing the road at one of the busiest intersections in Melbourne s central business district. Noori appeared in the Magistrates Court later on Saturday where he was remanded in custody. He will next appear in court on Wednesday. The court also ordered that Noori be assessed by psychologists. Islamist militants have used vehicles to attack people several times in Europe and the United States over the past couple of years. In January, six people were killed in Melbourne s central business district when a man used his vehicle to mow them down. Police also ruled out terrorism for that attack. Following the January incident, authorities installed 140 concrete bollards in the city center. Victoria State premier Daniel Andrews said 12 people remained in hospital, including three who in critical condition. He said there would be an increased police presence at Melbourne events, including the Boxing Day Test Cricket, carols and other major sports events.   ",0

11299,Kiefer Sutherland Returns. This Time the Oval Office Is His. - The New York Times,"TORONTO  —   Kiefer Sutherland was playing tour guide. On the set of the new ABC series “Designated Survivor” here earlier this month, he clutched a pack of Camels and walked,   slapping, through a replica of the West Wing, pointing out where the president’s chief of staff sits, running his hand along the curved wall of the Oval Office. In front of a painting of George Washington, he offered this historical nugget: “He was actually quite handsome but the painter hated him. Unflattering. ” Later, while ruminating on President Washington’s dental problems, Mr. Sutherland stood in a hallway with his back to another presidential portrait: his own. The placard beneath read Tom Kirkman. After spending nearly a decade protecting the president on the Fox series “24,” Mr. Sutherland now requires his own detail. On “Designated Survivor” he plays a   cabinet member who ascends to the Oval Office when Congress is wiped out by an attack during a State of the Union address. The actor leaves behind the   antics of the counterterrorism agent Jack Bauer to play a policy wonk thrust into a job he never wanted. Mr. Sutherland hasn’t exactly disappeared since “24” ended its regular series run in 2010. Among other gigs, he did two “24”  projects, and appeared in   fare, including Lars von Trier’s “Melancholia,” and “Forsaken,” a western with his father, Donald Sutherland. And in August, he released his first album, “Down in a Hole,” filled with   country songs that he helped write. He’s been touring extensively, recently appearing at the Grand Ole Opry. But these have mostly been quiet endeavors, at least relative to the cultural noise generated by “24. ” Mr. Sutherland’s first network series   the   “Touch” on Fox, failed to find an audience, and was canceled after two seasons. If the public wants a repeat of Mr. Sutherland leading a slick drama that giddily seizes the   political moment, then “Designated Survivor”  —   a glossy   of political thriller, “The West Wing”  nation building and domestic drama  —   might be the show that delivers him back to the affections of the mainstream. Mr. Sutherland, 49, sat on a leather couch in the president’s private office  —   slight his arms tattooed prone to long, circular sentences  —   remarking on the difficulty of not appearing too presidential amid such surroundings (even if they are fake). “The set’s so good that you can’t help standing a little straighter,” he said. “There’s something about how significant that office is. We watched Kennedy’s kids play there, Nixon getting himself out of Watergate. It does have an impact on your performance. ” With an   narrative driving this election cycle, Mr. Sutherland’s respectful nostalgia for political office seems surprisingly  . Television politicians these days are mostly venal, their cutthroat egoism wrung for drama on “Scandal” and for laughs on “Veep. ” “BrainDead,” this summer’s satire from the creators of “The Good Wife,” targeted elected officials by planting   space bugs in their skulls. But “Designated Survivor” leans more toward the idealism of “The West Wing. ” David Guggenheim, a   writer known for “Safe House,” had long been intrigued by the concept of the designated survivor, the person in the presidential line of succession selected to wait in a secure, undisclosed location when all other members of government are gathered elsewhere. After his usually encouraging friend Simon Kinberg (a producer of films, including “The Martian”) expressed little enthusiasm about one of his movie pitches in a   email exchange, Mr. Guggenheim  —   hoping to redeem himself  —   pulled out the designated survivor idea and hit send. Mr. Kinberg loved it, and Mr. Guggenheim wrote the script in two weeks. They took it to Mark Gordon, a veteran producer (“Grey’s Anatomy”) who immediately envisioned Mr. Sutherland as the lead. “Most actors are known for the thing that made them famous,” Mr. Gordon said. “Jack Bauer was active and macho, but Kiefer’s actually such a gentle, gracious guy. He can be the idealized president that we all wish we had. ” In Hollywood, an Everyman in the White House is often played for laughs: Chris Rock in “Head of State” Kevin Kline in “Dave. ” But the “Designated Survivor” premise  —   an entire government up in flames  —   is   almost shockingly grim. Mr. Guggenheim needed Mr. Sutherland to tilt the story away from tragedy. “We were killing   people right off the top but I didn’t want the show to live in that darkness,” he said. “I did want Tom to represent optimism. We pointed Kiefer toward ‘Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. ’” The   common sense that drives President Kirkman is, said Mr. Sutherland, a retort to cynics. “The lack of knowledge and understanding of how difficult it is to govern has led to some very poor ideas in our society,” he said. “Maybe showing the rebuilding of a government in action will help dial down the rhetoric that’s out there. ” Mr. Sutherland has found himself in the political fray before. “24” made its debut in November 2001 amid intense    anxiety. Jack Bauer’s propensity for grisly torture methods meant “24” was read by some as a revenge fantasy for a grieving country, and eventually criticized by others for wallowing in   violence at a moment where “enhanced interrogation techniques” became a national ignominy. “Once I was in an airport waiting to get on a plane and a woman looked at me and said: ‘How can you make that   show?’ It’s like: What are you talking about? We had the first   president on TV we had the first female president on TV,” Mr. Sutherland said. ‘‘When Jack Bauer was on his deathbed he didn’t ask for a priest he asked for an imam to apologize. I wish the show hadn’t become so politicized in the end, but I have no regrets. ” He may be particularly sensitive to the   label because in Canada he’s considered   royalty. To Americans, he’s known as Donald Sutherland’s son, but to many Canadians, he’s the grandson of Tommy Douglas, the Saskatchewan premier who brought universal health care to Canada and helped form the federal party that would become the   New Democratic Party. As children, Mr. Sutherland and his twin sister, Rachel, spent time in Canada’s parliament in Ottawa. “I remember eating hot dogs in the House of Commons and waiting for my grandpa,” he said. “I loved the debates. ” His mother, the actress Shirley Douglas, continued the activist tradition. In 1969, when she was involved with the Black Panther Party, she was arrested in Los Angeles, said Mr. Sutherland, not without pride. Mr. Sutherland’s parents divorced when he was 4, and Ms. Douglas relocated the family to Toronto four years later. The city now passes for his hometown he takes the subway to the suburban set every day, and his mother and sister live here. But as a student Mr. Sutherland attended six schools in five years. He dropped out at 16 when he was cast in the Canadian film “The Bay Boy,” arriving in Hollywood soon after. The welcome mat was out for   Packers: He roomed with Robert Downey Jr. and rose quickly, landing a string of 1980s hits: “Stand By Me,” “Lost Boys,” “Young Guns. ” “You think: ‘This is great, this is going to be the rest of my life.’ Then somewhere around 30 you get a knock back and realize, ‘Oh no, you should have held on tight. ’” He married and divorced young his daughter, Sarah Sutherland, now 28, plays Julia  ’s daughter on “Veep. ” The career lull of Mr. Sutherland’s early 30s was followed by “24,” a show that Natascha McElhone had never seen when she signed on to “Designated Survivor” as first lady. She didn’t know what friends meant when they joked: “Jack Bauer becomes president?” “Kiefer has large reserves of vulnerability,” she said. “There’s something quite breakable inside, which I think is not just endearing but unusual. He’s also quite a worker bee. ” An executive producer on the show, Mr. Sutherland has made suggestions that have been incorporated into it, including having Kirkman wear glasses (for a Clark Kent effect) and making Kirkman an independent (circumventing Republican and Democratic baggage) according to Mr. Guggenheim. For a Canadian with a green card, Mr. Sutherland is oddly smitten with the mythic American West. In the 90s, he had a ranch in Montana, and roped in rodeos, feeding on   country   like Merle Haggard and Johnny Cash. After listening to one of Mr. Sutherland’s early efforts at songwriting, his friend and writing   Jude Cole, encouraged him to record. “I said: ‘There’s a heartbreaking quality to your voice. No, you’re not this fantastic singer, but there are a lot of smooth singers out there, and there’s not a lot of Kris Kristoffersons,’” Mr. Cole said. An actor who crosses over into music can invite mockery or oblivion, but Mr. Sutherland was willing to take that risk. After years of playing guitar in his trailer, and with Mr. Cole running a music label, Ironworks, he was ready to put his own music out there. “I was prepared for a brutal beating, but the nice thing about finally getting to the age where I’m at is, well, as long as they’re not going to kill me, O. K. ” (The reviews have been mostly positive, if begrudging: “  …    actually kind of decent,” read the headline on the A. V. Club’s take.) Loss and drinking are common themes the title track is about a friend who drank himself to death. Mr. Sutherland’s drinking has been a tabloid punch line in the past: In 2005, he hurled himself at a  decorated Christmas tree in a London hotel lobby and a D. U. I. arrest led to a brief jail stint. Yet he seemed ambivalent when asked if his relationship to alcohol had changed. “It’s been a part of my life, there’s no denying that,” he said. “It’s not something I do alone. I like going out with friends after work. It’s a way of letting loose. Having said that, I can tell you that if I look back on my life any of the negative things that have happened usually have [drinking] as a root cause, whether it was a D. U. I. or fighting, or a breakup, a relationship not working. There’s a price to pay for it. If you take a look at the songs, none of them are positive. ” As an actor, Mr. Sutherland is used to telling other people’s stories. But the album is intensely personal a “journal,” he has said. The song “Calling Out Your Name” is about his split from Julia Roberts in 1991. Even after decades in the public eye, Mr. Sutherland said he found this level of exposure new, and perhaps liberating. “I would never ordinarily be that confessional, and when I first got onstage, it took me a moment to surrender,” he said. “But when I did that became one of the great experiences of my life. I’m grateful for how gracious people have been. It’s affected how I approached this part. I could let a bit more of myself into the character. It’s more personal. ” Whether this incarnation of Kiefer Sutherland  —   or any  —   can ever eclipse one of the most   roles in television history, only the public will decide.",0
22647,Cheesy Mashed Potatoes for the Soul - The New York Times,"In times of great stress, or of flickering,   dread, I find that canceling all my plans and staying in to make mashed potatoes generally helps. This year, there were quite a few opportunities to do so.   anxiety gnawed at me for months, lighting up old networks of pain in my shoulders and back. Mold bloomed around the mysterious wet patch that appeared in my bedroom ceiling. I started a thrilling, but terrifying, new job. And as the holidays neared, I worried about my grandmother, almost 80, living alone. Still, I let about half her calls go to voice mail each week, and hated myself for it. I turned to aligot, the   mashed potatoes with roots in central France. Aligot doesn’t fix anything, but it does put a little cushion between you and the abyss, whatever form the abyss might take. To make it, you’ll need a ricer. You could, technically, blitz everything together in the food processor, but you risk potatoes with the gooey, elastic texture of an   glue, setting up between planks. If you’re in a delicate emotional state, as I usually am when I start these potatoes, it’s better not to risk it. Besides, pressing down on the ricer is an essential part of the process. Squashing hot, tender potatoes through tiny holes is a pure and simple joy, one of the rare cooking tasks that’s just as fun as those   sets once had you believe. The potato rushes out in tiny, twirling, noodles. You don’t need to worry about lumps. In France, aligot is traditionally made with tomme fraîche or unripened Cantal, but those cheeses can be hard to find. At North End Grill, a restaurant in Manhattan’s Battery Park City, the chef Eric Korsh makes aligot with a little bit of roasted garlic and a lot of Comté. Any cheese that melts well will do, but for aligot you also want to seek out a cheese with a capacity for stringiness. I’ve had great aligot with Comté, Gruyère and Emmental, and fresh mozzarella can also work in a pinch. Ham   a chef at the Brooklyn diner Hail Mary, starts with Robuchon potatoes. Among cooks, the phrase “Robuchon potatoes” is shorthand for what many still consider the Platonic ideal of mashed potatoes: a flawless purée, mounted with an obscene amount of butter and named for the celebrity French chef Joël Robuchon. In a video dedicated to his famous mashed potatoes, Robuchon leans over a cook and says in French, quite sternly: “More butter! More butter! More butter! More butter! More, more, more!” Robuchon uses ratte potatoes  —   an expensive variety from France. He boils them whole, then peels them while hot. After pushing the potatoes through a food mill, he adds loads of cold butter over the heat and finally some milk or cream, whisking the whole thing until it’s an airy,   cloud. Waylly starts around there, then adds a mix of Gruyère and a   cow’s milk cheese from Vermont, even throwing in part of the bloomy rind. The key, he told me, is to whip the potatoes with confidence, vigor and speed once you add the cheese, to build up the stringiness as it melts. “When you pull it, you want it to seem like you’re pulling at fondue,” Waylly said. “You want to see a good amount of strands falling, and they should have some strength. They should fight with you. ” Stringiness is the whole point of aligot, that long, delightful stretch, the way it takes on all the qualities of melted cheese but remains mashed potato. And though it’s tough to get it like the cooks in Auvergne, some of whom can pull spoonfuls of hot aligot that stretch several feet, you can still get a good, cheesy texture as a beginner, working with a small amount of potato over low heat. At home, in the 20 minutes or so it takes for the potatoes to cook through, I like to get the rest of the meal going. I brown sausages and wilt a big bunch of greens in the same pan. I have a glass of whatever wine is open in the fridge. By now, things are looking up. Cheesy mashed potatoes are on the horizon, like sunshine after a long, dark night. And by the time those potatoes are ready, so am I. Recipe: Aligot (Mashed Potatoes With Cheese)",0
67938, 93 Percent Of The Great Barrier Reef Is Nearly Dead Because Of Climate Change,"In the book, The World is Blue: How Our Fate and the Ocean s are One, Marine Biologist Sylvia Earle wrote: Even if you never have the chance to see or touch the ocean, the ocean touches you with every breath you take, every drop of water you drink, every bite you consume Everyone, everywhere is inextricably connected to and utterly dependent upon the existence of the sea. A report released this week discovered roughly 93 percent of the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, the largest living structure on Earth, has been damaged due to coral bleaching. We ve never seen anything like this scale of bleaching before,  said Professor Terry Hughes in a press release. Professor Hughes is Director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, and leader of the National Coral Bleaching Task Force which produced the report.  In the northern Great Barrier Reef, it s like 10 cyclones have come ashore all at once. The task force evaluated 911 coral reefs by air around Australia, and found 93 percent were suffering from coral bleaching to some extent. The bleaching was found to be worse in the northern sector of the reef, where no coral has escaped its impact. Based on diving surveys, the researchers say they have seen nearly 50 percent coral death so far.According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, part of the United States Department of Commerce, increased ocean temperatures caused by climate change are the leading cause of coral bleaching. Coral depends on algae to survive, which is very sensitive to temperature changes. If warm temperatures remain constant for a long period of time, the coral dispels the algae, leaving it colored white, and eventually leading to the death of the coral if the stresses are prolonged. In 2005, the United States lost half its coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea due to a massive bleaching event. High carbon emissions absorbed by the ocean also decrease Ph levels, leading to ocean acidification. Observation stations monitored by the US EPA in Hawaii, Bermuda, and the Canary Islands found that in the past two decades, carbon dioxide levels in the oceans have increased, directly resulting in the acidification. These changes also put stresses on marine life, diminishing the quality of their habitats and depleting food sources. If emissions aren t reduced soon, the negative effects already being seen in these environments will be irreversible. The bleaching doesn t necessarily mean the coral is dead, but the greater the stressors causing coral bleaching, the less likely the coral is able to recover.  It can take thousands of years for coral reefs to fully form, so once the coral dies, those ecosystems are unlikely to ever recover. This is, by far, the worst bleaching they ve seen on the Great Barrier Reef,  Mark Eakin, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration s Coral Reef Watch, in an interview with the Washington Post.  Our climate model-based Four Month Bleaching Outlook was predicting that severe bleaching was likely for the [Great Barrier Reef] back in December. Unfortunately, we were right and much of the reef has bleached, especially in the north. Today on Earth Day, it is important to acknowledge and fully comprehend how dire the situation of our world s ecosystems are because of climate change. There is no time for incremental efforts. We must either make the necessary changes to mitigate the effects of climate change in the future now, or pay dearly for the consequences which will manifest exponentially in the near future. We can no longer treat our Earth as a source of infinite economic development when the resources on it are finite.Featured Image Courtesy of Flickr",1
52589,Supreme Court Strikes Down Ban on ’Racially Disparaging’ Trademarks - Breitbart,"The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit Monday, holding that a law prohibiting “disparaging” trademarks violates the First Amendment. [The unanimous Court in Matal v. Tam struck down a provision of the Lanham Act, the main law on trademarks, that barred the Patent and Trademark Office from issuing any trademark protections to marks that “may disparage   …     persons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols, or bring them into contempt, or disrepute. ”  This case concerned a rock band called the “The Slants,” a reference to the racial slur for Asians. When Simon Tam, the band’s   frontman, tried to register his group’s name with the trademark office, he was told he could not get a valid trademark because the name was offensive to Asians. Before the Court, Tam’s attorneys argued that his intention was to “reclaim” the term “slants” and subvert its offensive potential. The   provision, 15 USC §1052( a) has rarely had any practical effect, but has come to public notice in recent years as   advocates and public officials sought to use it to invalidate “offensive” trademarks. Most prominently, the Washington Redskins football team, who have twice had their trademark protections revoked for having a name that “disparages” American Indians. Writing for the Court, Justice Samuel Alito reasoned that the entire purpose behind the provision rendered it facially unconstitutional. “It offends a bedrock First Amendment principle: Speech may not be banned on the ground that it expresses ideas that offend,” he wrote. In contravention of this principle, the Patent and Trademark Office devised a test to determine whether a trademark was too offensive for the federal government to protect. If a “substantial composite, although not necessarily a majority, of the referenced group would find the proposed mark . . . to be disparaging in the context of contemporary attitudes,” the trademark could not be registered. This test, by disfavoring a certain subset of speech specifically on the view it expressed, constituted “viewpoint discrimination,” a fundamental limit on government’s power to regulate private speech. The provision was not saved by the government’s arguments that trademark protection was a matter of “government speech” or was a “subsidy” over which the first Amendment did not apply in its broadest sense. “If private speech could be passed off as government speech by simply affixing a government seal of approval, government could silence or muffle the expression of disfavored viewpoints,” the opinion reads: Holding that the registration of a   converts the mark into government speech would constitute a huge and dangerous extension of the   doctrine, for other systems of government registration (such as copyright) could easily be characterized in the same way. A concurring opinion by Justice Anthony Kennedy and joined by the Court’s more liberal justices, called the policy “the essence of viewpoint discrimination,” and determined there was no need to even consider the government speech and subsidy arguments. The same law was held unconstitutional on the same grounds by an en banc panel of the Federal Circuit in 2015. The government, then represented by   Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, petitioned to the Supreme Court in a last attempt to save the law. Monday’s ruling by the nations highest court cements the end of the seldom enforced provision.",0
54652,US Abstains From UN Vote Against Cuba Embargo,"Embargo Remains Politically Contentious Within the US   
For the first time ever, the US has abstained from the UN vote denouncing the ongoing US embargo of Cuba. The resolution passed through the general assembly 191-0, with the US and Israel the only ones abstaining. 
The UN has been voting overwhelmingly against the embargo for decades, but it is only in the past year that President Obama has started to criticize the embargo himself, and has sought to ease a lot of the long-standing restrictions on the island nation. 
The matter is hugely politically contentious within the US, however, with many in the Republican Congress condemning the White House for easing the restrictions, and the Congressional leadership so far preventing any more easing of the restrictions on commerce. 
The UN resolution itself is non-binding, and the real significance is not that it passed, but rather that the US abstained, which while reflecting the administration’s position is unusual, as it criticizes the US Congress internationally.  ",1
45225,The Russian media just loves the campaign to demonize Putin,"By wmw_admin on November 3, 2016 The Saker — The Saker.is Nov 3, 2016 Last May I wrote an article entitled Counter-propaganda, Russian style in which I explained that far from banning or censoring the western anti-Putin/anti-Russia campaign, the Russia media reported about it in meticulous detail. Half a year later, not only is this still true, but the level of coverage has now sharply increased. Check out this screenshot from the latest (and most watched) weekly news show: Putin bashing reported on Russian TV. Click to enlarge Remember that roughly 80% plus of the audience watching this are strong supporters of President Putin. You can imagine what they think when they see these reports. The fully understand that the West hates Putin so much precisely because Putin is one of them, a real Russian who cares for the interests of the Russian people. So when the West demonizes Putin, it is really all the Russian people who are demonized and their conclusion is simple: the West does not hate Putin, the West hates *us*. As for “Blame it on Putin” – it has now become a real joke. One of the main effects of this kind of demonization is that the Russian public fully understands that there is no way back. In practical terms, most Russians believe that even if Russia pulled out of Syria, stopped supporting the Donbass or even decided to hand Crimea to the Ukies, the West would still continue to demonize Russia and try to subdue her . Furthermore, the Russians remember that the only time when the West liked Russia was when she was run by the drunken Eltsin and his coterie of Jewish oligarchs who pillaged Russia and whose reign had consequences similar to what a major war would result in. Any other Russia is simply unacceptable to the AngloZionist Empire. Seen in this light, the alliance of the West with both the Nazis in Kiev and the “moderate terrorists” in the Middle-East makes sense. This is not fundamentally different from the European’s alliance with the Ottomans during the Crimean War or the USA supported Japan against Russia in 1905 (only to then end up fighting against Japan a few years later). As long as X is anti-Russian, the West support X. It’s that primitive and that stupid. The Ukronazi regime in Kiev has understood that it has only one “commodity” left which it can sell to the West: its rabid russophobia. And since they are desperate, they make desperate and, frankly, comical efforts. Check out the new symbol of the Ukie military intelligence service: The Ukies point a dagger at the heart of Russia. Click to enlarge I don’t think I have ever seen the Ukie inferiority complex better illustrated. The Latin sentence “ Sapiens Dominabitur Astra ” (“the wise will rule the stars”) is a nice touch as it combines a non-cyrillic (Latin) alphabet, a reference to European astrology in the Middle Ages and a typically Ukrainian (cosmic) megalomania. Yet another proof, if needed, that all the Ukraine is is an “anti-Russia”. Make no mistake though, there is absolutely no fear of the West in Russia. Most Russians believe that the Russian armed forces are more than enough to keep West in check. And they are quite correct. But there is this acute awareness that were in not for the Russian military, Russia would be treated just like Iraq. In the meantime, the Russia media is gleefully feeding the Russian public every bit of russophobic propaganda produced in the West. Future generations will probably study this period and wonder at the absolutely mind-boggling stupidity of a western propaganda machine which is apparently completely oblivious at the impact of its propaganda on a nuclear superpower.

61339,"[WATCH] Univ Of Alabama Students Try To Protest National Anthem, Then A Veteran Shows Up","0 comments Do you think that this Veteran’s actions were wrong? I think that #BAMASITS student protesters are a bunch of BLM Hippie whiners! Way to go, Colin Kaepernick! Your actions as a millionaire whiner in the National Football League have now influenced the young minds of young students at college football games. These kids are not even equipped with enough mental toughness to consider basic issues. You believe that your actions will help them to create a better life? Evidently, protesting the National Anthem is a fad that is not quite ready to die. One recent iteration can be found at the University of Alabama, where students use the hashtag #BAMASITS in an attempt to draw attention to their cause. These little babies have the right to protest, but like many who have a liberal mindset, they are only tolerant of others who share their views. If you stand up for your own views, as this Veteran did, you are behaving in ways that are “outside of your rights.” One representative of #BAMASITS, Emerald Vaughn, described the group like this: “#BAMASITS is a peaceful protest. We are protesting social injustice. We support underrepresented LGBTQ community and people of color against discrimination and we’re also protesting against police brutality.” Fine, Emerald. Have your protests. One question, though: What is wrong with a Veteran of the United States military standing during a game and sharing his own views? Teddi Badami, an Air Force Veteran, decided that he would do just that. Video has surfaced of the #BAMASITS crowd protesting the National Anthem at Bryant-Denny Stadium, prior to the Texas A&M game, when Badami stood in front of their protest with his hand over his heart. Badami simply stood and sang along with the words of the National Anthem. “I politely stood up to ask him, could you move and he said he was a veteran. I respect veterans, I don’t have anything against veterans but I felt like you shouldn’t try to invade and bully your way. That was total disrespect and disregard of our protest,” said Vaughn. Clearly, Badami does not feel that way. Take a look at video footage of the event, below: #bamasits says a veteran interrupted their peaceful protest, the vet says otherwise.

Do you believe that Badami was out of line? 
“I stood there with my hand over my heart and sang the national anthem loud and proud. I made no comments to any of the individuals other than I stand for the national anthem and that I served our country,” Badami said. 
“I felt that it was disrespectful, he can have his own, whatever his points that he wanted to make, he could have did that on his own. People fight over, they fight our wars with veterans for us to have the right to sit or stand for the national anthem,” Vaughn said. 
Badami says he and his friend returned to their seats after the anthem but were temporarily detained by campus police. 
Detained by campus police? Give me a break!",1
19556, Trump’s Election Fraud Claims Just Got Weirder And More Dangerous,"Donald Trump is doubling down on his bizarre claim that the only way that he can lose in Pennsylvania this October is because of electoral fraud. Trump began this narrative last week in Ohio where he said that he is  afraid the election is going to be rigged. We re going to watch Pennsylvania. Go down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people don t come in and vote five times,  Trump said at a rally in Altoona, Pennsylvania Friday.  If you do that, we re not going to lose. The only way we can lose, in my opinion   I really mean this, Pennsylvania   is if cheating goes on. That claim was made despite the fact that Hillary Clinton has maintained a very comfortable lead over Trump in the polls.Since then, Trump has doubled down on his claims that the election will be stolen from him in Pennsylvania. Trump s campaign has gone so far as to try and recruit supporters to act as election observers. Normally, recruiting election overseers wouldn t be too out of the ordinary for a campaign to do. However, traditionally campaigns hire or recruit people with a legal background to do the work. Trump s campaign is calling for anyone and everyone to answer his call to action. We have to call up law enforcement, and we have to have the sheriffs and the police chiefs and everybody watching,  Trump said on Friday.Calling in an army of your supporters, who will likely have no legal background, to hang out at the polls with a battalion of armed police officers sounds far more like voter intimidation than a move towards ensuring protecting voter s rights. Given the scenes of carnage that have come out of Trump s rallies, this move is almost sure to set up Pennsylvania s polling locations as the backdrops to a few riots. I am going to go ahead and predict that should events unfold that way; it ll be areas with minority populations that are targeted.Trump cannot give any evidence as to why there will be election fraud in Pennsylvania. How could there be? The election hasn t even occurred yet. He is spouting unfounded nonsense because he is desperate. Like a wounded animal trapped in a corner, Trump is flailing. As nice as it is to see Trump squirm, unfortunately, it is the people of Pennsylvania and the rest of the United States who will be scratched by the tiny nails on his tiny hands.Featured image from Jeff Swensen/Getty Images",1
57917,MESSAGE TO HOLLYWOOD GOES VIRAL,"This is the best yet! A message to Hollywood that went viral. It covers most of the things we think of when we think of the hypocrisy that runs rampant there:Hollywood:You lecture us about our carbon footprints while flying on private jets.You preach feminism while brutalizing women.You castigate violence while making millions off it in your movies.You condemn guns, with armed bodyguards at your side.You are the problem, not us.WELL SAID!LIBERAL HOLLYWOOD HAD THE WORST SUMMER IN 25 YEARS:With the list of Hollywood actors and entertainers that Americans have decided to boycott over their sickening public hate for our President, is it really any wonder we re seeing the worst box office numbers in 25 years? Meryl Streep used her allotted time for accepting her lifetime achievement award at the Golden Globes to trash President Trump. At the start of her dramatic speech, Streep bemoaned to her fellow liberals that Hollywood  belong to one of the most vilified segments in America right now .  It appears that she hit may have actually the nail on the head. The problem with arrogant actresses like Meryl Streep who falsely believe that because they ve been gifted with exceptional acting abilities, that Americans should fall in line with their radical political beliefs or we are ignorant.""As my friend Princess Leia said to me once: take your broken heart, make it into art."" #MerylStreep pic.twitter.com/GzOHo7O729 #GoldenGlobes  Richard Hine (@richardhine) January 9, 2017And then there s Robert DiNero, who called candidate Trump  a punk,   a pig  and  an idiot.  Only days before the election, DiNero angrily admitted that he would like to assault our soon to be President, claiming,  I d like to punch him in the face .The list of Hollywood losers who have made vile, unfounded and even threatening remarks against a man who has put his very successful life on hold in an effort to save our nation is vast. The list of Hollywood losers who have said they would like to harm our President is also rather significant, starting with Madonna who got a visit from the secret service after she told a large, adoring group of women at the Women s March in DC, that she d like to blow up the White House.And then there s  comedian  Kathy Griffin, who saw her career literally blow up after making an ISIS style video holding up a decapitated and bloodied head of President Trump. Is Hollywood s rapidly declining appeal really so surprising to most Americans who are 100% FED UP with their hate for middle-America?As Hollywood wraps up the all-important summer box-office season this Labor Day weekend, a sobering reality has gripped the industry.The number of tickets sold in the United States and Canada this summer is projected to fall to the lowest level in a quarter-century.The results have put the squeeze on the nation s top theater chains, whose stocks have taken a drubbing. AMC Theatres Chief Executive Adam Aron this month called his company s most recent quarter  simply a bust. Such blunt language reflects some worrisome trends. Domestic box-office revenue is expected to total $3.78 billion for the first weekend of May through Labor Day   a key period that generates about 40% of domestic ticket sales   down nearly 16% from the same period last year, according to comScore. That s an even worse decline than the 10% drop some studio executives predicted before the summer began.  LA TimesBreitbart   Even before this catastrophic Labor Day weekend is factored in (more on this below), the domestic 2017 box office is in hideous shape. This year is  6.3% behind 2016 and continues to fall behind 2015, 2013, and 2012.If you figure in inflation, those numbers are even worse. For example, in 2012 the average ticket cost $7.96. Today it is almost a full dollar more at $8.89. Yeah, things are that bad and will look even worse on Tuesday.With no apparent faith in their own product, this is the first Labor Day in 25 years where a new title has not been released on more than 1,000 screens. Over this weekend last year, the box office hauled in nearly $130 million. This year will do about a third of that.Summer attendance is at a 25-year low.The summer box office is down a whopping  16% compared to 2016.Can a handful of titles   It, Kingsman 2, Bladerunner 2, Thor 3, Justice League, Star Wars 8   save an entire year? Doubtful. Pull out of a dive? Maybe. Still, we are talking about only six big titles over four months, which is about on par with last year s Passengers, Rogue One, Doctor Strange, Fantastic Beasts, Inferno, Sully, and Magnificent Seven.",1
44780,McConnell rules out action this year on high court,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Sunday ruled out Senate confirmation of Democratic President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee this year, even if after the November election it appears the next president may pick a liberal who Republicans would like even less. In television interviews, McConnell said Republican senators had no intention of confirming Democrat Obama’s nominee, Merrick Garland, even if Democrats win the White House in November, putting them in the position to nominate someone more liberal than Garland when the new president takes office in January. “I can’t imagine that a Republican-majority Congress, in a lame-duck session, after the American people have spoken (in the election), would want to confirm (Garland),” McConnell told CNN. “That’s not going to happen,” McConnell told Fox News on Sunday. “The principle is the same, whether it’s before the election or after the election. The principle is the American people are choosing their next president and their next president should pick this Supreme Court nominee.” Nominees to the lifetime Supreme Court post require Senate confirmation. But McConnell says the Republican-run Senate will not hold a hearing or a vote on Garland. Republicans have said they want the next president to make the selection, hoping their party wins November’s election. Billionaire businessman Donald Trump is the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination. Garland, 63, is widely viewed as a moderate, admired by both Democrats and Republicans. Republican Senators Orrin Hatch and Jeff Flake last week raised the possibility of Senate action on  Garland late this year if Democrats keep the White House in the Nov. 8 election.  McConnell seemed keen to shut down that idea on Sunday, saying the Republican majority would not want to confirm Garland “even if it were soon to be in the minority.” Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid told “Meet the Press” that he thought the Republican facade against Garland would break, because some Republican senators already have said they would be willing to meet Garland, and one Republican - Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois - has said there should be a vote. “McConnell is leading his Senate over the cliff. And I am telling everybody that’s watching this, the senators aren’t going to allow that,” Reid said. The White House said it would stand by Obama’s nominee. “We will stand by him from now until he is confirmed and he’s sitting on the Supreme Court,” White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough said on Fox News on Sunday.

5398,Court Papers Give Insight Into Stanford Sex Assault - The New York Times,"PALO ALTO, Calif.  —   Proud parents converged at Stanford University’s commencement on Sunday to hear Ken Burns, the documentary filmmaker, welcome the elite class of graduates into the wider world. But across the idyllic university grounds, in the shade of a large tree, is a quiet stretch of lawn that speaks to a persistent and darker side of campus life, at Stanford and across the country. It was here in January last year, an hour past midnight on a Saturday night, that a young woman lay on the ground, unresponsive, her hair disheveled and knotted, her body covered in dirt and pine needles, and her dress hitched up above her waist. The assault of the    woman  —   she is described as Jane Doe in court documents  —   has led to a firestorm of outrage for what many saw as her assailant’s light punishment, a   jail term with the possibility of being released after three months. In March, a jury convicted the assailant, Brock Turner, 20, a champion swimmer and Olympic hopeful who was a freshman at the time, of intent to commit rape of an intoxicated or unconscious person and two related sections of the law, all felonies. The court papers, some of them released just last week, outline the complex and intense national debate over the sentence, and over sexual assaults on campus. Yet they also portray a case that legal experts say was unusual. The assault was not hidden in a dorm room or clouded by the complex emotions of a college romance. Mr. Turner and his victim had met only minutes before their encounter. The assault was taking place beneath the tree when a pair of Swedish students passed by on bicycles. The men stopped, and Mr. Turner began to run away. They chased him down and tackled him. “It happened in full view,” said Shanlon Wu, a   lawyer who is a specialist in campus rape cases. “You had unimpeachable witnesses  —   someone was basically caught  . ” The court papers and police reports depict an event that could be found virtually any weekend at any college  —   a fraternity party with   alcohol. The woman, who was not a Stanford student, was 22, working full time and living with her parents in Palo Alto at the time of the assault, according to court documents. She described the decision to go to a fraternity party on campus as a   lark and a way to spend more time with her younger sister, who accompanied her. After she had a meal at home and four shots of whiskey, she told the police, her mother drove her, her sister and two other friends to the Stanford campus at 11 p. m. The women ended up at a party hosted by a fraternity, Kappa Alpha, which was also attended by Mr. Turner. The woman’s sister told the police that they met several men at the party, but that “one of the guys was very aggressive and trying to kiss everyone,” according to a police report. She later identified that man as Mr. Turner and said she had twice repelled kissing and advances by him. The sister left the party to accompany an intoxicated friend back to her room, and soon after the victim and Mr. Turner left the party, according to court documents. Mr. Turner told the police that he and the victim kissed and then walked away from the fraternity house holding hands and ended up on the ground kissing. He removed the victim’s underwear and penetrated her with his fingers. He said he never took his own pants off. The Swedish students who came upon Mr. Turner and the woman said they stopped to intervene because they saw Mr. Turner on top of her, thrusting his pelvis toward her, court papers and the police reports say. They said she appeared motionless, her eyes closed and her head tilted to the side. One of the men yelled to Mr. Turner, who “looked up, slowly got off of” the victim “and began running rapidly away from her,” according to a case summary by the prosecutor. The Swedes chased him and brought him to the ground. After the assault, the woman told a police officer that the last thing she remembered was being with her sister at the party. Her next memory was waking up in the hospital feeling groggy and confused, she told the police. The court and police documents detail the level of drinking by everyone involved. Both Mr. Turner and the woman were heavily intoxicated, according to police reports. Mr. Turner reported having seven beers and a “couple of swigs” of whiskey. In addition to the four shots of whiskey she had at home, Jane Doe reported having two shots of vodka and “some beer” once she had reached the Stanford campus. She remained unconscious for three hours after paramedics reached her and began giving her treatment, including an intravenous drip, police reports said. The degree to which the inebriation of both Mr. Turner and the woman should have been a factor in sentencing was a central point of contention. Monica Lassettre, the probation officer who wrote sentencing recommendations, advised the judge to be lenient partly on the grounds that Mr. Turner was drunk. “This case, when compared to other crimes of similar nature, may be considered less serious due to the defendant’s level of intoxication. ” She recommended four to six months in a county jail, even though Mr. Turner faced a maximum sentence of 14 years in state prison. She also based her recommendation on what she said was his “sincere remorse and empathy for the victim,” and his lack of a prior criminal record. Alaleh Kianerci, the deputy district attorney who prosecuted the case, saw the woman’s intoxication as a reason for a harsher sentence, and she urged the judge to impose six years. The fact that the victim was so intoxicated was an “aggravating factor warranting a prison sentence,” Ms. Kianerci wrote. “Ultimately, the fact that the defendant preyed upon an intoxicated stranger on a college campus should not be viewed as a less serious crime, than if he were to assault a stranger in Downtown Palo Alto,” Ms. Kianerci said. In the woman’s courtroom statement, which went viral when it was released to the news media a week ago, she described drinking too much and blacking out as “an amateur mistake”  —   but not a criminal act. “Regretting drinking is not the same as regretting sexual assault,” she said. “We were both drunk, the difference is I did not take off your pants and underwear, touch you inappropriately, and run away. ” The victim added in her statement that she remains deeply traumatized by the assault. In a widely circulated comment in the courtroom when issuing his sentence, Judge Aaron Persky of the Santa Clara County Superior Court, said there was “less moral culpability” for a defendant who is intoxicated. His sentence was harsher than the probation officer asked for, but a petition for his removal has now swelled beyond a million signatures. The court papers paint diametrically opposed pictures of Mr. Turner. Family members and friends describe him in sentencing documents as gentle, polite and, in the words of a former high school teacher, “an individual of true kindness, compassion and promise. ” Adjusting to the social life at Stanford was difficult, Mr. Turner said in his own statement to the court. “Coming from a small town in Ohio, I had never really experienced celebrating or partying that involved alcohol,” he wrote. The prosecution’s sentencing memo, however, described a man who embraced numerous forms of illicit drugs both at Stanford and in high school. The memo said the police concluded from photos and text messages found on Mr. Turner’s phone that he was “engaging in excessive drinking and using drugs,” including LSD, ecstasy and an extract of cannabis. Mr. Turner had a previous arrest for underage alcohol possession in November 2014, the memo said. The prosecution document also said he aggressively flirted with women. Detectives interviewed two women who had “an encounter” with Mr. Turner the weekend before the assault, the memo said. He was “touchy” and put his hands on one of the women’s upper thigh. Mr. Turner had “creeped” her out because of his persistence, the woman told the police. Ten days after his arrest, the university reached an agreement with Mr. Turner that he withdraw from the university. “That was a much more expedited process than if we had gone through a formal expulsion process,” Lisa Lapin, a Stanford spokeswoman said. “It was the harshest punishment that the university can have. ” The woman’s courtroom statement continued to reverberate across the country and campus this past week. Michele Dauber, a Stanford law professor who has helped create the university’s policies for dealing with sexual assault complaints, called her a new Rosa Parks. “We are at a real watershed moment in public perception of campus sexual assaults,” said Ms. Dauber, who is also leading the effort to have Judge Persky recalled. In a letter submitted to the court, Ms. Dauber said that a recent university survey found that 43 percent of senior female undergraduates said they had experienced nonconsensual sexual assault or misconduct. Ms. Dauber is friends with the victim and said she is helping her to obtain a book contract. Mr. Turner is banned from campus, and as part of his criminal sentence, Mr. Turner will also be registered a sex offender for life.",0

Posted by Elliot Bougis | Nov 16, 2016 | Breaking News Just when you thought it was safe to go back on the Internet… 
I have been reporting for weeks now about the D.C.-based “pizza pedophilia” ring that is being exposed based on thousands of “Podesta emails” released by Wikileaks in the past month or two. 
As of last week, the case became even more explosive. 
— Thomas Bernpaine (@ThomasBernpaine) November 11, 2016 
Now, don’t get nervous because it looks like computer mumbo-jumbo. You only need to remember two things. 
1 –Every picture file is actually a code/pattern of numbers that our computers “translate” into images on the screen. 
2 – Some “extra” information has been discovered in at least one picture code/pattern from a Wikileaks email. 
I reported weeks ago about this “pedo ring” something called “photo steganography,” which is just the fancy term for the two points I explained just now. 
The image (.jpg) of the two girls eating pizza was discovered as an attachment in the Podesta emails by Wikileaks. Data can be hidden in a .jpg file. In that image, a zipped directory (PK) was hidden inside. That doesn’t happen by accident. The directory likely contains illegal imagery and/or discussion. It is highly suggestive of illegal activity connected to child pornography, child exploitation, and child abuse. 
Some have objected that the pizza.jpg file size is simply too small to contain any useful data (like an image, a link, a message, etc.), but the point is this: all the file would have to “smuggle” is a short password to open a secret website or .zip file. The hidden data could literally just be a few bits of information but it could open up thousands of gigabytes of data in the right website or compressed file. That’s how the users would access the dirty pictures, videos, messages, etc. 
So, from a technical angle, this method is very possible, and it makes sense of why the Podesta emails include so many strange photo attachments. Are all those attachments little “Trojan ponies” for sharing images, videos, passwords, payment resources, etc.? 
WATCH (Language/NSFW Warning): “Why do we even have an FBI? Is the FBI just covering for these people?” 
Let me be honest: 
I have researched corruption cases like this for many years, whether in current events or from historical records. So, I believe I have a somewhat thick skin when it comes to facing human sinfulness and evil like this. 
Last Friday night, however, I won’t lie: I totally lost it. 
All of a sudden, too many lightbulbs went off at once, too many connections hit me at once, too many implications dawned on me at once–and I just went into a kind of panic attack about how massive this whole cartel is, how well protected it is, and how truly destructive it is in real children’s lives. 
If you want to get an idea of what set me off, let me show you three images. 
BUT I WARN YOU: When you understand the context, these images are EXTREMELY DISTURBING. 
First, here is a photo of Tony Podesta’s favorite work of art in his home: 
Tony Podesta is a big fan of “The Arch of Hysteria” 
Next, here is an ad from Ping Pong Pizza, a restaurant in D.C. that has numerous, very disturbing connections to pedophilia and D.C. elites like the Podestas. Another “arch of hysteria”? 
Next we come to a police photo from the Jeffrey Dahmer case. 
VIEWER DISCRETION ADVISED: 
I wonder if Tony Podesta would also like this “arch of hysteria”… 
Finally, here is the logo for Comet Pizza, another D.C. restaurant with deep connections to Ping Pong Pizza and the Podestas. Can you see now why I “lost my [bleep]” last Friday? 
Worse, in terms of how protected this satanic ring of perverts is, I recently reported that even the DOJ is compromised . 
A man named Arun Rao has shown a disturbing interest in some sexually “creepy” images and expressions that are connected to the Podestas and this pedo ring. The problem is that Rao is an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the DOJ. 
Specifically, Rao is Supervisor of the Southern (“Greenbelt”) Division office for the DOJ’s District of Maryland in Chevy Chase, Maryland. This means that Rao’s district is virtually on top of the area in D.C. where Besta Pizza operates. In addition, Besta Pizza and two other associated properties are directly over abandoned underground tunnels, many of which could easily connect to Chevy Chase. 
On top of his social and geographical proximity to Alefantis, Rao’s DOJ division handles cases that seem tailor-made for busting—or covering up—the dark circles that sex traffickers hide in: federal racketeering, conspiracy, national and international fraud and corruption, immigration violations, counterfeiting, and —wait for it—child pornography . 
In closing I will leave you with three “infographics.” 
They are very complicated and “dense” so I don’t expect everyone to examine them. 
However, even if you don’t look into the details yourself, I want you to be aware of how vast this whole network of evil is, and, therefore, of how many hands and prayers we need on deck to expose it and bring it down. 
(NOTE: You don’t have to download these images to view them. You can just right-click open them in a separate internet browser tab, and click “+” to zoom in.)

First, a diagram of “key players” in the pizza restaurant side of the pedo ring. You can see the diagram for yourself here . 
Second, a much larger diagram of how this pizza-pedo ring connects to international kidnapping (esp. the Madeleine McCann case) and other DNC allies like “spirit cooker” Marina Abramovic. 
Finally, a truly massive diagram of connections that implicate nations and leaders around the world, and put the sex trafficking cartel in the context of a global network of drug dealers, slave traders, murderers, and media elites.

33992,Saudi Arabia's advisory council studying proposals to protect whistleblowers,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia s Shura Council, a top advisory council to the government, is studying proposals for protection of people who report financial crime, local media reported, following the government s anti-corruption crackdown. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has launched an inquiry into graft that has resulted in the detention of a dozens of princes, senior officials and businessmen. The Shura Council does not have legislative powers, but it can propose laws to the king and the cabinet. It said in a tweet on Monday that it had agreed on the  appropriateness of the draft proposal  for whistleblower protection for financial and administrative corruption. The Arabic-language newspaper al-Riyadh reported on Tuesday that the council had agreed to study two proposals on the matter that also included protection of eyewitnesses who report violations such as financial crime. A top official said earlier this month that Saudi authorities have questioned 208 people in an anti-corruption investigation and estimate at least $100 billion has been stolen through graft.  The Government of Saudi Arabia, under the leadership of King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is working within a clear legal and institutional framework to maintain transparency and integrity in the market,  Attorney General Sheikh Saud Al Mojeb said in a statement on Nov. 9. The investigation has spread to the neighboring United Arab Emirates, as the UAE central bank asked commercial banks and finance companies there to provide details of the accounts of 19 Saudis detained in the crackdown. The UAE central bank governor said last week the request by the central bank for local banks and finance companies to provide details of the accounts of 19 Saudi Arabian citizens was just an information-gathering exercise.

53050,Charleston Church Holds First Service Since Shootings,"""We ask that everything be done with dignity. There will be no backpacks, fanny packs or cameras. This is for security purposes,"" a man doing crowd control at the church told the swarm of people assembled near the door.

Church members were given priority among a crowd that included mostly visitors and press. Women were allowed in first in a show of chivalry but also for security. ""We will be checking pocketbooks,"" announced one usher.

Before long, the organist began playing ""Amazing Grace"" followed by ""What a Friend We Have in Jesus"". The choir, dressed in all white began the service, by singing ""Total Praise"", a gospel song that brought the crowd to its feet.

""We are reminded this morning of the freshness of death. It comes like a thief in the night,"" said Norvel Goff, reverend and presiding elder of the African Methodist Episcopal district that includes Emanuel. Goff called congregants to the altar to pray. ""Many of our hearts are still broken. Many of us are still shedding tears. But we must take our burdens to the Lord and leave them there.""

Goff continued, ""As we try to make sense of nonsense, pray for our children. We pray that God will give us the clarity of thought to share with them what God has shared with us.""

One man erupted in tears on the way back to his seat repeating over and over, ""This is just an unthinkable tragedy. Help us, God.""

Calvary preaches many things, including the inevitable rapture, the second coming of Jesus, and the “monogamous marriage between male and female as the foundation of the family.” The majority of the few dozen in attendance on Sunday were white.

“This is what anger and hate against the church looks like,” Pastor Richard Perea said of the killings. “The liberal media must now care about church in a way they have not before.”

Sunday’s sermon focused mostly on Bible study, going line-by-line through Biblical verses much in the same way ""The Beautiful 9"" at Emanuel did before alleged mass murderer Dylann Roof turned a gun on them.

“I don’t think it has anything to do with religion, not at all,” Ashworth said, adding that in this time of tragedy, more people need to pray.

“It was obviously a race issue in his heart,” Perea told HuffPost. “But why he went into a church versus down in the street, in my opinion, is something that was demonically influenced.”

“After everything that’s happened in the past week, coming to church means that God is still sovereign,” Brooks said. “He still gives us this freedom to come and not be afraid even when people are prejudiced with hate in their heart.”

When service was over at Emanuel A.M.E., parishioners were greeted by a sea of support from members of the community. Some people handed out bottles of water and cookies to churchgoers as they left the building. Others just shared kind words and hugs.

Jack Logan, 52, the founder of a Put Down the Guns Now, a nonprofit based in South Carolina that is dedicated to reducing gun violence among young people, said he attended the service at Emanuel A.M.E. for that feeling of connection.

 

 “This was a tragedy for South Carolina, and America,” Logan said. “I wanted to come down here, show love and take part in this great church service today.”

Another visitor, 28-year-old Ryan Shepard, a court clerk, drove to Charleston from Atlanta just to be at Emanuel’s first church service since Wednesday’s tragedy.

 

 “I think we’re in an important point in American history as it relates to race relations and facing some of the darker chapters of our nation’s past that we haven’t reconciled,” Shepard said. “I wanted to be present and a part of this mourning process, to witness and support the community here.”",0

It was one of the FBI s most elaborate and successful counterintelligence operations in history.After the FBI arrested 10 of the spies in June, 2010, Secretary of State Clinton worked feverishly to return the Russian agents to Moscow in a hastily arranged, lopsided deal with Putin.It all happened as the uranium deal was in play: An arrangement to provide Moscow s state Rosatom nuclear agency with 20 percent of American uranium capacity, with $145,000,000 to pour into the Clinton Family Foundation and its projects.For the Clintons, the FBI s biggest counterintelligence bust in history couldn t have come at a worse time.The day the FBI arrested the Russian agents, on June 28, 2010, the day before the secretary of state s husband, Bill Clinton, was to give a speech in Moscow. A Kremlin-connected investment bank, Renaissance Capital, paid the former president $500,000 for the hour-long appearance.An unnamed Hillary Clinton spokesman told ABC News that there was  no reason to think the Secretary was a target of this spy ring. That was a lie.Under the code name Operation Ghost Stories, the FBI had been working the ring for a decade. Its targets had burrowed in along the Acela Corridor between Boston, New York, and Washington DC. They lived normal daily lives as Americans to attend universities, run businesses, marry, and conceive and raise children to infiltrate society and subvert government institutions. One of the SVR agents had stolen the identity of a six-week-old Canadian baby who had died in 1963. That prompted the Ghost Stories code name. The ring inspired the FX network s television series,  The Americans. As with any secretary of state, Hillary Clinton would be a primary target under any circumstance. But she was much more. She was a known quantity: predictable, vain and ruthless, and with an insatiable desire for cash to enrich her family, friends, and political machine. Blindly ambitious to become president of the world s only superpower and swearing to come back after losing in 2008 to Barack Obama, she was the 21st century KGB s perfect mark.Read more: Daily Caller",1
38849,Texas TV: From the Sublime to the Ridiculous - The New York Times,"The latest entry in the booming genre of   TV is “The Son,” an AMC drama based on the captivating historical novel of the same title, which sounds promising. It stars as its Texan patriarch the very Irish Pierce Brosnan, which does not. Maybe Mr. Brosnan will pull it off. As an actual Texan (now living in New York) I’m rooting for him. But I know that Lone Star TV has a   track record. For every “Friday Night Lights” there is a “Walker, Texas Ranger” and several   reality shows. As a result, Texans have learned to approach shows set in our state with clear eyes and managed expectations. Here is a survey of Texas TV, arranged in order from the realistic to the ridiculous. [ Related: In ‘The Son,’ the Novelist Philipp Meyer Lassoes TV ] It’s hard to describe the weird buzz of football Fridays in Texas towns, as anticipation builds throughout the day to explode that night in garish light, color and sound. Luckily I don’t have to: “Friday Night Lights” nailed it, as it did most details. These include the push and pull of hometown relationships that confine and nurture in equal amounts the egalitarian marriage between the Taylors (Kyle Chandler and Connie Britton) and the cinematography captured in and around Austin. When the sunlight turned golden in the Dillon sky, it was enough to make a Texan expat homesick. “King of the Hill” was an animated show full of clownish characters. But it was also attuned to the rhythms of the Texas exurbs, its families’ schedules defined by school functions and trips to the Mega Lo Mart. The rare sitcom that treated Southern characters with respect rather than mockery, it nevertheless took sly aim at the way Texan grandiosity collides with reality  —   oversize riding mowers tending modest lawns  —   and how outmoded ideas about masculinity endure. Or as Hank Hill once put it: “Bobby, if you weren’t my son, I’d hug you. ” Larry McMurtry became the bard of Texas partly by deflating its myths, and this 1989   is a prime example. William D. Wittliff adapted the screenplay from Mr. McMurtry’s novel about a cattle drive from Texas to Montana, which depicted the West as a place of raw beauty but also cruelty and sudden, ghastly death. Gus (Robert Duvall) and Call (Tommy Lee Jones) the aging   saddling up for one last adventure, represent the twin poles of classic Texanhood  —   swaggering   and gritty stoicism. More important: Their drawls are tremendous. “Dallas” was, for a time, the most popular show on television and Larry Hagman’s J. R. Ewing is one of TV’s most indelible characters. But when it comes to authenticity, the Ewings were all hat and no cattle, even when you set aside the car crashes, the affairs and the infamous dream season. The show was shot mostly in Los Angeles and looks like it, and its glitzy boomtown of   Stetsons and freewheeling oil barons was a fairy tale. TNT’s 2012 “Dallas” update was more representative of the city. It was filmed there, and its urban apartments and diverse subplots were truer to a modern metropolis. The melodrama was milder, and a cynic might surmise that that’s why the show lasted only three seasons, compared to the original’s 14. But the competitive pressures of   TV and Mr. Hagman’s death probably had more to do with it. The Dallas installment of the “Housewives” franchise debuted in 2016 and it’s hard to imagine why it took that long. The latest in a string of reality shows (“Dallas Divas and Daughters,” “Big Rich Texas”) about the city’s ladies who lunch  —   and bicker and backstab and slurp “Jesus Juice,” or wine, in the show’s vernacular  —   the series wallows in tired stereotypes about big hair, big rocks and big plastic surgery bills. The thing is, they’re not (totally) wrong. Spend an afternoon at the Neiman Marcus flagship and soon you’ll be mentally casting your own reality show. But it’s not a representative depiction of the city. Visit the Texas Ranger Hall of Fame and Museum in Waco and you’ll find fascinating artifacts and plenty of lore surrounding the mythic, still active law enforcement group. But you won’t see a dojo, which is only one of the reasons the   “Walker, Texas Ranger,” starring Chuck Norris, was so laughable. As patrolled by Walker, Texas was an   ThunderDome, a place where grudges were occasionally hashed out with helicopters and    missiles. Texans love their firearms, sure, but try fitting a rocket launcher in the gun rack of your pickup.",0
12701,"Germany, Italy, Sweden and the UK Facing New Muslim Challenges","
Look at what is happening now across the European continent! Europe is being occupied by invading hoards of millions of Muslims as we speak, demanding more mosques to be built with state money (tax payer money), chanting Allahu Akbar in the streets, teaching Muslim prayers in schools, banning Christmas street lights and more!
Some of these migrants even took it to a step further, now posing as “children”. Some stupid Europeans actually believe them and adopted them as their own children. 20-30 even up to 40 year old men! Imagine adopting a 30 year old man as your “child”…
Despite having nationalist political parties surging across the continent, there has been no major victory!!! The nationalists do NOT own a single country in Europe! France is still under socialist Hollande, Austria, Netherlands, Italy, Greece everyone is still under socialist/liberal leadership.
Despite having the UK historically exiting the EU with their famous Brexit vote, the UK is still under “principled conservative” leadership, you know that conservatism similar to Paul Ryan (open borders). The country fell on Theresa May’s hands after Boris Johnson who helped Nigel Farage make Brexit happen cucked-out and refused to take the leadership. Theresa May is super similar to David Cameron, the former Prime Minister who resigned after Brexit. Both David and Theresa are like Jeb! Bush or Paul Ryan clones. Same “principled conservative” rhetoric but with open borders.
Europe is basically lost and no one can do anything about it at this point. Even a classic revolution is impossible at this point. There’s no spirit, we don’t have a strong leader here in Europe like they do in America, with Donald Trump, our European nationalist leaders are all weak, soft cucks. The people are too materialistic, they chase money, music, movies, games like nothing else matters.
Here’s the average European daily conversation in BOTH West AND East Europe: “Look at my new car! Do you like it?? You wanker, who cares about Muslim immigration, check out my new Iphone 7! And have you heard that new Beyonce song which tells whites to fuck themselves? Wow its so awesome! By the way I’m going to Ibiza next week! Bloody hell mate, let’s play my new FIFA 17 PS4 game before you go, it has awesome graphics mate! It’s better than PES 17!!!” This is no exaggeration and this is exactly how European people behave these days. All Europeans, UK, France, Spain, Sweden, Germany, Denmark, Poland, Italy, Austria, Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, even Russia, EVERYONE! Total cuckoldry!
Some people like to think that East Europe is somewhat purer and holier than the West but it’s not anymore. Especially Americans have this idea that Eastern Europe is not as tainted as the West. Its the same thing, the eternal chase of entertainment.
The question is what’s next? How would Christians survive as minorities among these peaceful people? Perhaps we should pack our bags and start a new white flight to Russia. As long as Putin is in power we know he is gonna protect the rights of European Christian people and ensure their survival. Lets hope and pray he would allow us to invade his country. While Russia is no different in those terms, at least they have a leader who watches over them and protects them while they have fun. Another option would be to pack our bags and move to America if Trump wins and IF Trump would allow us to go there…. because we do know he’s very anti-immigration. Should Hillary “win” (steal the election) may God help us all because WW3 is upon us.
So here’s a bunch of new Muslim challenges Europe is now facing:
GERMANY – Children Forced to learn Muslim prayers and shout Allahu Akbar 

Pupils at a primary school were forced to chant “Allahu Akhbar” and “there is no God but Allah”, an appalled father has claimed.
The father of the pupil at the girl’s primary school in German ski resort Garmisch-Partenkirchen discovered that his daughter had been forced to learn the Islamic prayer when he discovered a handout she had been given.
He claimed she had been “forced” by teachers to memorise the Islamic chants and forwarded the handout to Austrian news service unsertirol24.
The handout read: “Oh Allah, how perfect you are and praise be to you. Blessed is your name, and exalted is your majesty. There is no God but you.”
It had been given to the girl during a lesson in “ethics” at the Bavarian school.
ITALY – Thousands of Muslims Pray in the Streets of Rome near Colosseum, Shout Allahu Akbar, Demand more Mosques 

Thousands of Muslims gathered in protest outside Rome’s Colosseum Friday after Italian authorities shut down a number of so-called “garage mosques” to avoid young people becoming radicalized.
The Muslim community of Rome chose the iconic Colosseum, a worldwide symbol of Christian persecution and martyrdom, to stage their demonstration against the alleged shutting down by police of illegal places of Muslim worship in the city.
Many Roman citizens were visibly disturbed by the protest, noting that in its propaganda videos, the Islamic State has repeatedly employed images of the Colosseum when threatening to conquer Rome and the “Crusaders.”
Two months ago, Italian police set up a high-security perimeter around the Colosseum, after the Islamic State issued a new threat to “conquer” Rome in its latest video.
UNITED KINGDOM – British press wants more 40-year-old migrant “children” posing as 16-year-old 

Won’t you take pity on this poor, innocent little child?
This image of a “16-year-old” migrant crying – which is currently plastered on the front page of The Guardian – is nothing short of laughable.
“A 16-year-old from Ethiopia cries while he awaits registration at a processing centre in the makeshift refugee camp near Calais,” the photo’s caption reads. The image is placed under a headline reading: “Councils resist pressure to take children from Calais.”
The “child migrant” is clearly in his 40’s, yet their editors evidently believe their readers are so incredibly stupid they’ll actually believe they’re looking at a 16-year-old boy.
This comes amid a recent report where grown men pose as children in the UK , get adopted by British families then threaten to “love” them in exchange for their care. Some were even caught drawing ISIS flags on 1st grade coloring books.
SWEDEN – Christmas Street Lights BANNED to Avoid Offending Muslim Migrants 

Towns across Sweden have banned Christmas street lights in the name of “security,” but the real reason is almost certainly because the country has completely capitulated to Islam after importing countless Muslim migrants over the last two years.
According to an SVT report, The Swedish Transport Administration (Trafikverket) will not allow municipalities to erect Christmas street lights on light poles that the authority manages, meaning that many towns will have no festival lights at all on major streets.
Despite there being no safety issue with the street lights for decades, this new rule has been instituted right after record numbers of Muslim migrants flooded into the country – just a coincidence I’m sure.
In reality, the Christmas lights ban is almost certainly an effort to avoid offending Muslim migrants who are causing chaos in cities like Malmo, where the firebombing of cars and businesses in or near Muslim ghetto ‘no-go areas’ is becoming a routine occurrence.

41350,Review: Bryan Cranston Shines as Lyndon Johnson in ‘All the Way’ - The New York Times,"Bryan Cranston brings his Tony   interpretation of President Lyndon B. Johnson to television on Saturday night in an adaptation of the Robert Schenkkan play “All the Way,” and it’s still quite a sight to behold, just as it was on Broadway in 2014. Nothing beats witnessing this kind of    portrayal onstage, of course. But the television version, presented by HBO, offers plenty of rewards, allowing Mr. Cranston to work the   and liberating him from the confines of a theater set. In his hands, this accidental president comes across as an amazing bundle of contradictions, someone who seems at once too vulgar for the job and just right for it. Mr. Schenkkan adapted his own play (which also won a Tony) for HBO, and he and the director, Jay Roach, have quickened the pace a bit. The slice of history, though, remains the same: Johnson’s pivotal first year in office, from his swearing in after John F. Kennedy’s assassination through his 1964 campaign for election to a full term. The first half of the film, its most compelling stretch, focuses on Johnson’s wheeling and dealing to get the Civil Rights Act of 1964 passed. Other prominent figures of the era are manipulated by this master of political hardball: senators like Hubert H. Humphrey (Bradley Whitford) and Richard B. Russell Jr. (Frank Langella) J. Edgar Hoover (Stephen Root) the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (Anthony Mackie). Some, especially King and other black leaders, are quite good at manipulation themselves. Given all we hear about the current climate in Washington, “All the Way” is enough to make you misty for the days when   in the interest of securing significant achievements was what national politicians did. Not that the film gilds this era. We hear some of the actual arguments used to oppose civil rights legislation (sometimes via archival clips of George Wallace and others) and they’re mighty ugly. Is the verbiage today any different? The film invites us to make the comparison. Halfway through, Mr. Schenkkan turns his attention to the presidential campaign of 1964, with Johnson showing signs of paranoia about his Republican opponent, Barry Goldwater, and about the possibility of a challenge from Robert F. Kennedy. The details of the story grow a bit technical  —   a tussle over the seating of black delegates at the Democratic convention takes up a lot of time  —   but Mr. Cranston keeps it watchable with a performance that grows ever more fervent but never goes over the top. [See our NYT Watching picks for what else you should watch this weekend] The main obstacle in turning the play into TV fare is that “All the Way” has considerably more competition on television than in the theater. Muscular political drama is an entire genre on the small screen, whether it’s made up (“The West Wing” and all its thematic offspring) or based on historical events (“Game Change” and “Recount,” both of which Mr. Roach also directed for HBO). There’s a sameness to a lot of these offerings: the lurching from one crisis to the next the brusque, pithy exchanges that rarely last more than a few sentences the cursory attention to secondary characters. (Lady Bird Johnson, the first lady, played by Melissa Leo, is the most noticeable casualty in “All the Way. ”) Also sapping power from this film is that we’re only a few years removed from the orgy of   coverage of the watershed events of 1963 and ’64. With those caveats, “All the Way” is still solid historical drama, and Mr. Cranston’s performance is a gem.",0
50766,Senator-elect Jones not joining calls for Trump resignation,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat Doug Jones, who scored an upset victory last week in the U.S. Senate race in Alabama, said on Sunday he did not believe President Donald Trump needed to resign over sexual misconduct allegations against him. “I don’t think that the president ought to resign at this point,” Jones told CNN’s State of the Union program. “Those allegations were made before the election, and so people had an opportunity to judge before that election. I think we need to move on and not get distracted by those issues.” More than a dozen women have accused Trump of making unwanted sexual advances against them before he entered politics.  Accusations of sexual harassment against high-profile men in politics, media and the entertainment industry have put a new spotlight on the allegations against Trump, and several Democratic senators have called on him to resign. Trump and White House officials have denied the allegations. The accusations emerged during the 2016 presidential campaign, when a videotape surfaced of a 2005 conversation caught on an open microphone in which Trump spoke in vulgar terms about trying to have sex with women. Trump apologized for the remarks but called them private “locker-room talk” and said he had not done the things he talked about. Jones prevailed in the Senate race against Republican Roy Moore, who himself had been accused of sexual misconduct. Jones’ victory in the deeply conservative state of Alabama was a political blow to Trump, who had endorsed Moore. ",0

44982,Pioneertown Wants to Be the New Old West - The New York Times,"YUCCA VALLEY, Calif.  —   The Pioneertown Motel is a dusty,   inn with 20 rooms in a remote community named Pioneertown, in the middle of the desert in Southern California. The motel, recently renovated by its new owners, has an outdoor makeshift lobby and offers few amenities aside from morning coffee,   and a parking space large enough for a pickup truck outside each room’s door. Across the parking lot is a street that was built as a film set, with an   saloon, post office, bowling alley and a trading post. In April, the motel was fully booked, with a wait list. Hundreds of music lovers had caravaned from the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, Calif. looking for a party. They found it in Pioneertown where a   jamboree called the Speakeasy was in full swing.     and their   boyfriends sprawled out on colorful couches under tents outside the motel. They drank canned beer and smoked cigarettes by day, huddling around firepits at night, starlight and guitars in ample supply. This setting may seem incongruent to its backdrop. But this is the new Old West. Pioneertown, 125 miles outside Los Angeles, was founded in 1946 by a group of Hollywood legends including Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, Russell Hayden and Dick Curtis. They were tired of traveling far to film the westerns that were popular at the time. They built facades and spaces to replicate a   western town, as well as the motel, where they stayed up into the night, drinking, playing cards, staging duels and then sleeping it off before starting again. The dream of turning Pioneertown into a permanent playground with golf courses, hotels, restaurants and large homes never materialized. There wasn’t enough money or water. But 70 years later, Pioneertown is having something of a renaissance, thanks to an influx of artists, entrepreneurs and other beautiful people from Los Angeles, Silicon Valley and New York City looking for a new hub for work and play. Julian T. Pinder, a filmmaker, moved to Pioneertown in 2014 from Los Angeles with his wife, Yasmina Jones. Their friends were perplexed by their decision to do so, initially. “At first they are like: ‘What are you doing in the middle of the desert? What do you do up there? You are insane,” said Mr. Pinder, 34. “Then they come up here and stay for a weekend, and they meet all these amazing artists and everyone is just totally laid back and there is a stress level that is gone. ” Mr. Pinder and Ms. Jones were attracted to Pioneertown as an alternative to the Los Angeles lifestyle. “We were paying six grand a month, and we were doing jobs we didn’t want to do,” he said. “Finally, I said: ‘Forget it. Instead of wasting this money on rent, I can come here and buy 40 acres for 100 grand. ’” Theirs is one of the first homes seen when driving from the main highway into Pioneertown. Mr. Pinder and Ms. Jones renovated what was a     mining cabin into an airy family home that has huge windows, a beamed roof, an open kitchen and 40 acres of uncultivated land. Somewhat by necessity, Mr. Pinder has learned to kill rattlesnakes. Pioneertown is an unincorporated community, so small that you can address parcels with someone’s first name and they will arrive at the right place. You can drive for miles without seeing another human or even a building people’s homes can be about a   drive apart. The boulders, the sand and the Joshua trees make the landscape look otherworldly. Cellphone service is spotty. But the remoteness is among its greatest attributes, say people who have moved there recently. Yves Kamioner, a Belgian jewelry designer, and his partner, Hugh Glenn, a retired   executive, left their New York life and their Fifth Avenue apartment four years ago. Since then, they have bought and restored three homes in the area, including one that came with a church. “The desert is a blank page, and people come here to reinvent themselves,” said Mr. Kamioner, 59. “You are like a kid again. There is oxygen up here. ” Claire Wadsworth, a teacher, and Nikki Hill, a chef, were residents of Los Angeles when they took a weekend visit to Pioneertown in April 2015. They decided on the spot to move there. “Someone told us there was a restaurant for sale, and 10 days later we had the keys,” said Ms. Wadsworth, 31, who married Ms. Hill, 33, last year. “We were just so in love and wanting something different in life,” Ms. Wadsworth said. The couple opened the doors to their new restaurant, La Copine, in the area about six months ago. It would be hard to find the tiny restaurant, on the side of a sparsely populated   highway, if not for the crowds of people and cars that always surround it when it’s open  —   mostly for brunch, Thursday to Sunday. The crowd could rival that of the newest haunt in the West Village: Beautiful artist or graphic designer couples come with friends to laugh and gossip over juice spritzers and organic   grits. To kick off the Speakeasy festival in April, La Copine hosted an     dinner of spring pea and tendril salads and coq au vin (wine was B. Y. O. B.) for locals and tourists alike. The local music business is growing. Rocco Gardner, a   musician, has built a     music recording studio. “We now have the stuff you need to have Beyoncé come and stay and record,” he said. This spring, he gave a party to show off the studio. Musicians, actors and other scantily dressed,   partygoers took selfies in the hot tub against the unobstructed views of valleys and Joshua trees. The fashion scene, with an aesthetic influenced by Pioneertown’s proximity to music festivals, is developing as well. Promised Land, a vintage store, opened five months ago nearby. Its racks and shelves are overflowing with Bohemian skirts, maxi dresses, jumpsuits and leather jackets. Jay Carroll, 36, a brand consultant who once was a creative director for Levi’s, moved to Pioneertown in 2015. With a partner, he is starting a men’s wear line. With his wife, Alison, he is starting a company called Wonder Valley that sells olive oil. Mr. Carroll understands the lure of the dusty western town. “I’m sure it correlates to the fact that the market in L. A. has gone up,” he said. “There is also the fact that simple living is such a new hot topic with young people, and this is definitely a place you can do it with it being two hours from L. A. ” Not everyone is excited about the newness of the old Pioneertown. Jim Austin, 58, has lived there for 12 years in a house called Rimrock Ranch on a quirky plot of land with numerous structures, including a red barn with the word “breathe” written on it. Nearby, there is a display of rocks in the shape of a heart that surrounds two Joshua trees. From some vantage points, it looks like trees are kissing. Mr. Austin came to Pioneertown when it was truly a sleepy nowheresville. Now he thinks it is time to move on. He sold the ranch to a young couple from Oakland. “It is a little too crowded for me,” he said. “It was time for me to bug off rather than becoming that grumpy old dude trying to stop change. ” Matt and Mike French, brothers from Portland, Ore. are among those fueling the change. Mike, 27, and Matt, 32, bought the Pioneertown Motel in December 2014, after discovering it while visiting their parents in Palm Springs, 30 miles away. After a refurbishment of the hotel, the brothers celebrated its reopening, welcoming some 80 friends and relatives to Pioneertown. They enjoyed an outdoor dinner under the stars, a sunrise dance party and hikes in Pioneertown Mountains Preserve. “We want to be the door to the desert,” Mike said.",0

""It means that the Russian Central Bank has been running a justifiable policy, because the bank has been purchasing gold during the recent three years. Now gold will cost even more. Citizens still have an opportunity to buy gold investment coins that are VAT-free in Russia, unlike bullions. ""In Russia, there are three ways of investing in gold. They include unallocated bullion accounts in banks - bullions and coins. This method is bad because unallocated bullion accounts are excluded from the deposit insurance program.

13420, WATCH: Army Vet WRECKS Trump – Here’s the REAL Reason He Gave Generals More Control Over Bombing,"Trump was supposed to be a non-interventionist, but, allegedly as soon as he saw videos of poisoned children on cable news (the same children he doesn t want coming here because other videos that were edited showed him that refugees were all big, burly, 20-something men and not mothers and children), he decided we had to intervene in Syria. And he attacked. Then he attacked Afghanistan with the biggest bomb we have.Then he was lauded for both moves, and also lauded for giving more control over this kind of thing to his generals. But Army vet Jason Kander, speaking on CNN s  State of the Union,  has hit the nail on the head for why Trump really gave that control to his generals: I believe he wants to take credit for good things when they happen, and blame generals when bad things happen. Kander also explained that there were only two acceptable answers to why Trump would make such a move: He s the commander-in-chief, and he also needs to defend the reasoning behind why a commander on the ground actually made the decision to bomb Afghanistan with the biggest one we ve got.Had the MOAB failed to do anything at all, Trump would definitely have blamed the general who actually authorized dropping it. Kander backed his position up by explaining how Trump blamed the generals who were in charge of the failed Yemen raid, where we lost Navy SEAL Ryan Owens. Instead of saying,  We lost him,  Trump said,  The generals lost him.  Kander also used Trump s own pseudo-explanation of whether he authorized the MOAB drop to back that truth bomb up: If you think back to when he was asked whether or not he approved the dropping of the MOAB in Afghanistan, his answer was something along the lines of, it started with  Uh,  and then it went from  Uh,  to  Everybody knew exactly what was going on,  which was, of course, the opposite of true.

33150, Trump Firing Special Counsel Investigating Russian Connections A Possibility According To Attorney,"Robert Mueller, the man selected in May by the Justice Department to head the investigation into Russia s interference in the 2016 presidential election, probably thought the job was relatively secure when he initially accepted the position, but now Donald Trump s attorneys most likely have Mueller second-guessing his decision.In an interview on Sunday, Jay Sekulow, one of Trump s attorneys, alluded to the fact that he wouldn t completely rule out the possibility that the president may fire Mueller from leading the investigation into Trump s campaign. Why would he fire Mueller? Simply because he can.ABC s George Stephanopoulos was interviewing Sekulow on the program This Week on Sunday and the topic of the investigation came up. Stephanopoulos asked Sekulow if the president would give any assurance that he would not interfere in the investigation into Russian ties or order U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a man that many believe has already committed perjury on more than one occasion since he was sworn in for the position in early February, to fire Mueller. Sekulow s response wasn t particularly convincing. Look, the President of the United States, as we all know, is a unitary executive,  Sekulow said during the interview.  But the president is going to seek the advice of his counsel and inside the government as well as outside. And I m not going to speculate on what he will, or will not, do. So, not only did Sekulow not give any assurance that Trump would pledge not to meddle in the investigation or have Mueller fired, he completely avoided acknowledging both points. In fact, Sekulow went on to add that he  can t imagine  the issue of firing the head of the investigation would arise, but  that, again, is an issue that the president with his advisers would discuss if there was a basis. Nobody said getting to the bottom of the Russia scandal was going to be easy.Featured image via Andrew Burton/Getty Images",1
14119,"Trump, Hillary, and the End of the US Empire: A Russian View","October 29, 2016 -  By Eduard Popov for Fort Russ - translated by J. Arnoldski - 


For the first time since the Cold War, the “Russian question” has become an important part of the debates between US presidential candidates. In turn, Russia is highly interested in a favorable outcome of the elections in the United States. In Russia itself, discussion has long been raging over which one of the US presidential candidates is better for Russia’s interests: Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton?  
Russian society’s sympathy undoubtedly belongs to Donald Trump, as Clinton has a high disapproval rating given her personal qualities and approach to Russia. If she is elected president of the United States, then she will likely become the most unpopular head of the White House in Russian public opinion. 
The “Russian question” is part of a more global question of the new world system in which the US is losing its status as the world’s sole superpower. Russia is playing an important role in changing the American Empire’s status, perhaps even a leading one. But the American crisis is even more comprehensive and goes far beyond Russia’s influence. A Russia dreaming of returning its former imperial greatness is less to blame for the fall of the US’ imperial influence than the irrationality of the American elites themselves.  
Russia survived two collapses in the 20th century consequential of internal factors.  The two Russian revolutions of the 20th century (1917 and 1991) were the result of a low quality of the ruling class and the undermining of their authority in society. The external factor was important, but still only a subsidiary cause of the collapse of the government and society. I believe that America is facing a similar crisis.  
As the author of these lines was told 10 years ago by an astute and recognized scholar, a former citizen of the USSR who emigrated to the US in the early 1990’s, America is today undergoing the same wrenching transformations that the Soviet Union experienced in the Perestroika period. This scholar’s view of the future of his new homeland was exclusively pessimistic - he believed that the US would not cope with its own restructuring primarily because of the unsuitability of its own elites. 
Of course, my opinion as a person who knows little of America and the opinion of the more knowledgeable above-mention citizen are only personal ones. But the emergence of the phenomenon of Donald Trump is not a detail, but an objective consequences of the deep crisis of the American system.  
The Trump phenomenon demonstrates at least two critical factors: (1) the complete alienation of the American elites (or as the Czech communist ideologist Dr. Skala says, the American ‘nomenklatura’) from the people, and (2) the American nomenklatura’s complete loss of touch with reality. Both are painfully reminiscent of the situation in the USSR before Perestroika.  
The late Soviet elites (the ‘nomenklatura,’ as they were pejoratively called in society) turned into a closed caste. Even though, in my opinion, they were still more democratic than the current American elite, the Soviet nomenklatura sacrificed the interests of real modernization of the country’s social-economic system and ideology for the sake of pursuing geopolitical phantoms. Perhaps I am wrong, but such ""false idols"" prevail in the minds of the current American nomenklatura even more.  
In the US, factories are closing, migration is growing, Mexico is slowly realizing a Reconquista (the return of their lands in the southwestern states of the US that were annexed as a result of an unjust war), and all of this is happening against the backdrop of imperial overstretch. The US is striving to control not only its backyard, Latin America (which is being actively penetrated by Chinese capital, another manifestation of the phantom thinking of the American nomenklatura), but also Ukraine, for which Russia is ready to fight to the last breath.  
America does not have the strength for this. But the American nomenklatura does not have the slightest interest in taking care of things at home and concentrating on domestic issues. Continuing American expansion is akin to Trotsky’s permanent revolution. Such is intriguing and vivid, while home repairs and cleaning toilets is infinitely boring and tedious. 
This is why the US presidential elections will be won by the political lunatic and American Trotskyist, Hillary Clinton, who does not strive for realism or call for cleaning the Augean stables like Donald Trump does. 

Obviously, for Russia it is better to deal with a US government which defends its own national interests, not phantoms of pseudo-democracy and its declining imperial power. But little depends on Russia’s opinion. Therefore, it is advisable to prepare for and objectively observe the course of the fight whose outcome is practically a foregone conclusion.

67713, N.C. NAACP Plans Sit-Ins To Force Repeal Of Anti-Gay Law,"Like most sane people and organizations, the North Carolina NAACP is furious over House Bill 2, North Carolina s new sweeping piece of bigoted anti-LGBT legislation. They are so furious, in fact, that they will be using an old tactic from the 1960s Civil Rights Movement to force Gov. Pat McCrory to repeal the law: sit-ins.Matt Barber, who is the president of the North Carolina NAACP, says he is giving McCrory until April 21st to get rid of this terrible law, or there will be sit-ins until he does. Barber says of the law: We cannot be silent in the face of this race-based, class-based, homophobic and transphobic attack on wage earners, civil rights, and the LGBTQ community. Together with our many allies, we will coordinate a campaign of nonviolent direct action along with other forms of nonviolent protest that will instruct our legislators with respect to the rights of all people. Because the next session of the House doesn t start until the 25th of April, they would need a special session to meet Barber s demands by his April 21st deadline. Barber s Forward Together Moral Movement is behind the organization of the sit-ins, and more information will be forthcoming. They are also the group responsible for North Carolina s now-famous Moral Monday activist activities.Of course, the bigots on the wrong side of history are not going quietly into the dustbins of history where they belong, either. The Christian Action League of North Carolina has already planned a rally in Raleigh, the state s capitol, to stand in solidarity with the bigoted lawmakers who made discrimination legal. This event will take place this coming Monday, and there will be counter protests as well.Another event will be held at the governor s mansion on this coming Wednesday, and it isn t your usual protest either. A group of people will assemble an air horn orchestra  in order surround McCrory s home with lots of loud noise. He really ought to love that one.Bravo, NAACP. Thank you for your support, and for standing on the right side of history.Gov. McCrory   Shame on you.Featured image via Equality NC Twitter",1
484,Gov. Jerry Brown Endorses Hillary Clinton Ahead of California Primary - The New York Times,"LOS ANGELES  —   Gov. Jerry Brown of California has run three times for president. He is serving his fourth term as governor and stands as one of the most popular elected officials in the state. He has also kept a noticeably low profile as the Democratic presidential primary contest has moved to California, reflecting what aides described as the interest he had in both candidates. But that ended on Tuesday as the Democratic governor came off the sideline and endorsed Hillary Clinton as someone who has the “tenacity and skill to advance the Democratic agenda” and defeat the presumptive Republican candidate, Donald J. Trump. “Democrats have shown  —   by millions of votes  —   that they want her as their nominee,” he said in an open letter to Democrats and to independents, who are permitted to vote in the Democratic primary on June 7. Mr. Brown’s decision is the latest sign that California is shaping up as a climactic end to the Democratic nominating session. Mrs. Clinton and her opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have turned their attention to a state where Mrs. Clinton had once been confident of victory, and where one poll last week showed the two candidates essentially tied. On Tuesday, Mr. Sanders continued plowing through a heavy schedule of rallies in California, many in parts of the state where national candidates do not often go. Mrs. Clinton has scaled back plans to campaign in New Jersey to add additional events in the state, with a focus on Southern California, where she will be counting on minority voters to propel her. Nonetheless, she told MSNBC on Tuesday that she was “feeling very positive” about California. “We are competing everywhere, but I have been struck by some of the challenges California faces,” Mrs. Clinton said, criticizing Mr. Trump for denying the state’s drought. Mr. Sanders is spending about $1. 8 million on advertising in California, and Mrs. Clinton about $1 million, according to Kantar  . That is not a lot of money in a state like California, where a robust media campaign can easily cost $5 million to $10 million a week. Both candidates are concentrating their advertising campaigns, focusing on places like Fresno, Sacramento and Los Angeles. Mr. Sanders, after giving a speech on health care in Emeryville, across the bay from San Francisco, told reporters Tuesday that he was not surprised by Mr. Brown’s decision, noting that governors and other elected Democrats had repeatedly endorsed Mrs. Clinton, a former senator from New York and secretary of state. “I like Jerry Brown, but people can make their own choices,” Mr. Sanders said. “What we have had to do, and we have done pretty well in every state in this country, is taken on Democratic governors, taken on Democratic senators, taken on Democratic members of the House, Democratic mayors and all of their political apparatus. And yet we have won in 20 states, and I think we are going to win here in California. ” Mr. Brown, in his letter, offered strong praise for Mr. Sanders, noting the similarities between the Sanders campaign and the one Mr. Brown waged when he ran for president in 1992. “He has driven home the message that the top 1 percent has unfairly captured way too much of America’s wealth, leaving the majority of people far behind,” he wrote. “In 1992, I attempted a similar campaign. ” Still, the governor, who lost to Bill Clinton in a contest that left lingering bitterness between the two men, offered a powerful case against Mr. Trump in arguing that Mrs. Clinton had proved not only that she had abundant support among Democrats, but the ability to win in November. Mr. Brown met privately with Mrs. Clinton in San Francisco and Mr. Clinton in Sacramento last week. Mr. Trump, Mr. Brown noted in his letter, “has called climate change a ‘hoax’ and said he will tear up the Paris Climate Agreement. ” “He has promised to deport millions of immigrants and ominously suggested that other countries may need the nuclear bomb. He has also pledged to pack the Supreme Court with only those who please the extreme right,” Mr. Brown wrote. “The stakes couldn’t be higher,” he added. Even if she loses here, Mrs. Clinton will almost certainly have enough delegates to win the nomination. But a loss in the largest state  —   and in a Democratic stronghold  —   would not only provide a dark end to what has been at times an unhappy campaign, but might also empower Mr. Sanders to stay in the race, further delaying the point when Mrs. Clinton can turn her full attention to Mr. Trump. To win the nomination, Mr. Sanders would have to persuade hundreds of   superdelegates  —   party officials and leaders like Mr. Brown  —   to switch their allegiance in time for the July convention. Winning California, his aides say, can help him make that case. Tad Devine, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders, said the senator would campaign heavily through Primary Day, going to parts of the state where he knows he can draw huge crowds and television coverage. “We think we have a very narrow path to get there,” Mr. Devine said of winning the nomination, “and California is the most important piece of that puzzle. ” A poll last week showed the two candidates essentially tied in the state. But many analysts say this is a difficult contest to poll, because there has been a huge   surge in registration and because it is challenging to project how many independents, who have favored Mr. Sanders, will actually participate.",0
41131,Al-Qaeda's Assault on Aleppo Continues Despite Lack of Progress,"Al-Qaeda's Assault on Aleppo Continues Despite Lack of Progress 
Rebels are doing a lot of dying but not taking much ground so far Print Originally appeared at The Moon of Alabama 
For four days now al-Qaeda in Syria (aka Jabhat al Nusra aka Fatah al-Sham) and assorted other ""rebel"" groups have tried to attack Aleppo from the west to break the siege on al-Qaeda associated groups in east-Aleppo. The New York Times in now openly admitting that CIA supported groups are acting under al-Qaeda's operational command. The piece though, which belonged on page one, was in the back of the paper. There is no public outcry over this disturbing fact. 
The attack on west-Aleppo had been talked about for over two weeks and the defenders are well prepared. waleppoattack.jpg 

As can be seen on the map above the areas al-Qaeda and its allies managed to capture so far are only small rural outskirts. Every attempt to attack actual city estate under roof was repelled by the defenders. Small infiltrations like shown in the map were immediately cleaned up. The marked area is back in the hands of the Syrian army. It is estimated that the several thousand attackers have so far lost more than 500 men. A 1,000 more are likely injured. Every attack has to be carried over mostly open land and is received by heavy artillery fire. Air attacks ravage their supply and preparation ares. 
The attackers launched over 20 suicide-vehicle bombs so far but only a few reached their targets and their damage was limited. Yesterday one suicide vehicle bomb, ready to be launched for a new attack, was hit by a missile from a Syrian helicopter and exploded at its preparation and launching position. Over 60 ""rebels"" were killed by it and their attack had to be call off. 
The good news is that the defense is holding. The bad news is that the al-Qaeda ""rebels"" received huge amounts of artillery missiles and launchers from their ""western"" and Gulf sponsors. Several hundred have been launched at the densely populated areas of west-Aleppo. More than a 100 civilians have been killed by them and several hundred civilians were wounded. Some of the missiles contained gas and people had to be taken to hospital with extreme breathing difficulties. The UN envoy condemned these attacks as ""possible war crimes"". 
The whole attack operation was launched under the direct supervision of al-Qaeda in Syria leader Abu Muhammad al-Golani. He was shown in pictures at the ""rebel"" headquarter of the attack discussing further operations. 
Despite any progress on their part the al-Qaeda forces seem far from giving up. More attacks to break the siege are expected. We can be sure that some of their surprises are still in store. But the defenders are ready and the Syrian army is said to prepare for a large counter operation which may include a serious effort to liberate east-Aleppo of the al-Qaeda occupation. 
Other fronts in Syria are relatively quiet. The Turks have been told by Russia to stop all air attacks within Syria. The message has been received. The Turkish plan to occupy Al Bab east of Aleppo is unlikely to happen as it would be out of range of the Turkey based artillery and have no air support. The U.S. would like to go to Raqqa but has no proxy ground force to do that. Some Obama officials are now arguing for more U.S. boots on the ground in Syria. Will Obama agree to that mission creep?",1
29797,"Army Triumphs at Last, Ending Navy’s 14-Game Streak in Rivalry - The New York Times","BALTIMORE  —   Tradition at the   game calls for each team’s players, at the game’s end, to stand in front of their fellow students and sing their alma mater, with the winning team singing second. On Saturday, for the first time since December 2001, Army sang after Navy did. Army had pulled off a      victory that ended a     losing streak to Navy. And when the game ended, with Army running out the clock in front of a capacity crowd announced at 71, 600 at MT Bank Stadium  —   a crowd that included   Donald J. Trump  —   thousands of members of the   Corps of Cadets jumped over the fence to flood the field. Which, in turn, made for a pretty loud backup chorus. “I can’t put words to it,” said Edgar Poe, a senior wide receiver who finally learned what it feels like to beat Navy. “It’s surreal. It doesn’t even feel like it’s for real. ” The winning touchdown was a thrilling one: The junior quarterback Ahmad Bradshaw scored on a   run with six minutes to play, putting Army back ahead after it had squandered a   halftime lead. Navy still holds a   edge in the series, which dates to Nov. 29, 1890, and also includes seven ties. And although they were severely   in this game because of injuries to top players, the Midshipmen ( ) made Army ( ) earn the victory. Which it did. “We’ve heard for a long time about the streak and all that,” said Army Coach Jeff Monken, who is in his third season at West Point. “It was good to be part of the team that put that to an end. ” Army’s fumbles helped Navy climb back into the game in the second half, and when Navy quarterback Zach Abey broke three tackles early in the fourth quarter on an option keeper that turned into a swerving,   touchdown run, the Black Knights trailed for the first time all day. But Army, suddenly down by   immediately responded with a     touchdown drive that ate up 6 minutes 42 seconds and ended with the touchdown run by Bradshaw, who had thrown an interception and lost a fumble earlier. “I told the guys to just be prepared  —   they may try to make us do something foolish to draw a flag,” Bradshaw said. “I told them to keep their composure, to protect the ball  —   to focus on ourselves. ” After Bradshaw scored, a determined Army team held Navy to 6 yards on three plays, forcing a punt. The Black Knights then pushed through for two first downs to end the game. “We persevered through everything,” Andrew King, an Army senior linebacker, said of the game and the season. “We fought hard, executed, and most of all, we finished. ” Brandon Jackson, a sophomore cornerback, had been killed in a   accident after Army’s second game of the season. On Saturday, his mother, Morna Davis, made her first appearance at a game since his death, Monken said. Afterward, she was with the team in the locker room for the celebration. “To share that victory with her, and for her to see how much she means to these guys, was really special for all of us,” Monken said. For a half, it seemed as if Army was going to break the losing streak with ease. Just a week earlier, in a   loss to Temple in the American Athletic Conference championship game, Navy had lost quarterback Will Worth and slotback Toneo Gulley to   foot injuries on the same play. The damage from that loss seemed to hang over Navy as Army turned an early fumble by Shawn White into a     scoring drive that concluded when fullback Andy Davidson plunged in from the   line. Later, after a   Navy punt, Army went ahead,   as another   run by Davidson capped an   drive. As for Trump, he waved to the crowd and pumped his fist as he arrived during the first quarter and then watched the game from two luxury suites, one linked to Army, the other to Navy. At halftime, he appeared on the CBS television broadcast of the game, said he was “absolutely neutral” and suggested that the quality of the game might not be the best but that the spirit was. After Trump left the broadcast booth, the second half began, and the momentum swung abruptly when Bradshaw quickly lost a fumble at the Army 32. Abey completed a screen pass to White that picked up 16 yards and then muscled into the end zone on a keeper that cut Navy’s deficit to   less than four minutes into the half. The Midshipmen picked up a   field goal by Bennett Moehring and took the lead on Abey’s touchdown run. But Army found a way when it really mattered. Asked how he felt about ending the streak, Rhyan England, a junior free safety for Army, said, “The biggest thing is relief. ” Poe, his teammate, found himself searching for something beyond the appropriate words after it was all over: his helmet. But the victory he will have forever.",0
42023,BREAKING: MI Court Of Appeals Orders Vote Recount To STOP…Jill Stein’s Democrat Activist Attorney Says Count Must Go On,"The Michigan Court of Appeals rejected Green Party candidate Jill Stein s request for a recount of presidential ballots in Michigan.The court ruled that the Board of State Canvassers should not have allowed the recount, because Stein has not chance of winning the presidential election due to the recount. Accordingly, we grant the requests of the Attorney General and President-Elect Trump for issuance of a writ of mandamus,  a court official said in a statement.  We direct the Board of State Canvassers to reject the Nov. 30, 2016 petition of candidate Stein that precipitated the current recount process. We retain jurisdiction. The Michigan Court of Appeals agreed that Jill Stein is not an aggrieved candidate and the recount must stop.  A.G. Bill Schuette (@SchuetteOnDuty) December 7, 2016The U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the federal judge s order to continue the hand recount, but the Michigan Court of Appeals rejected the recount process.The U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals made clear, in their ruling, that  If, subsequently, the Michigan courts determine that Plaintiffs  recount is improper under Michigan state law for any reason, we expect the district court to entertain any properly filed motions to dissolve or modify its order in this case. The combined effect of the two rulings appears to set up further court proceedings in front of Goldsmith and the Michigan Republican Party has already filed for another federal hearing. Andrea Bitely, a spokeswoman for Schuette, said the Michigan Court of Appeals said  there is no conflict between  its order and the federal district court s temporary restraining order, so the recount should end immediately.However,  to ensure clarity for Michigan taxpayers, (and as recommended in the 6th Circuit s opinion issued this evening), the Attorney General is now filing in the federal district court a motion to dissolve the temporary restraining order,  Bitely said.Mark Brewer, an attorney for Stein, said the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals refused to stay the Republicans  request to stop the recount, so it will continue until all the parties can get back to federal court to plead their case, again, before Goldsmith.The state panel said that to qualify as  aggrieved,  Stein  must be able to allege a good faith belief that but for mistake or fraud,  she would have had a reasonable chance of winning.    Legal InsurectionOpponents of the recount claim that it s too expensive and that Stein, who received just 1 percent of the vote, is wasting resources. This is a win for Michigan taxpayers,  Michigan Republican Party chairman Ronna Romney McDaniel said in a statement.  The Michigan Court of Appeals ruled in our favor, determining that the petition for recount filed by Dr. Jill Stein should have been denied. Dr. Stein is not an aggrieved candidate as she has no chance of winning the election in Michigan. The legal arguments are being heard in both state and federal courts, and the attorney general said the battle could theoretically end up in front of the U.S. Supreme Court. I m just saying, theoretically, it could go there,  Schuette said.  I m just taking it just one step at a time, and I m convinced, and I have confidence in the Michigan court system, and the Michigan judicial system, to uphold the Michigan statute, and the Michigan law will prevail. Schuette said the battle is a matter for the state courts because he said there is no U.S. constitutional right to a recount.Stein s campaign handed the Michigan secretary of state a check for $973,250 on Wednesday. The campaign said it intends to pay all fees associated with the recount in Michigan, and is currently recruiting volunteers to observe the hand recounts that are likely to take place in 19 sites, representing all 83 counties across the state.Meanwhile, Michigan Republicans said the request for a hand recount of presidential votes could cost taxpayers up to $12 million, a dozen times more than Stein will have to pay.I m not sure why the votes that were counted by machines that were said to be counting votes more than once (and perhaps even multiple times) in a heavily Democratic county are allowed to stand in the final count and will NOT be recounted. Why were those voted included in the final vote that was CERTIFIED by the state of MI?Watch at the end when the reporter asks the election official if MI residents should be concerned about those votes and he simply glosses over his question: ",1
7182,"After Gingrich Attacks Megyn Kelly Over 'Sex,' Trump Advisor's 'Threat' Against Her Blows Up Online","Share on Twitter 
On Tuesday night, an interview between Fox News host Megyn Kelly and Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich got intense in a hurry. 
After Kelly referenced Trump as a “sexual predator,” Gingrich fiercely accused her of “using language that’s inflammatory that’s not true,” adding : 
“You are fascinated with sex and you don’t care about public policy! That’s what I get out of watching you tonight!” 
If viewers were fired up by the heated exchange, a tweet sent out by the Trump campaign's social media director Dan Scavino only poured fuel onto that fire: . @MegynKelly made a total fool out of herself tonight- attacking @realDonaldTrump . Watch what happens to her after this election is over. — Dan Scavino Jr. (@DanScavino) October 26, 2016 
While it's not explicitly clear what Scavino meant by “watch what happens,” the implications of his comment certainly didn't go unnoticed. 
Americans quickly came down on both sides of the issue, with many rushing to Kelly's defense in the face of the “threat”: @DanScavino ""Watch what happens to her?"" I'm no Kelly fan, but your campaign really isn't learning from the whole ""threats vs women"" thing. — Dennis Perkins (@DennisPerkins5) October 26, 2016 . @DanScavino She does just fine after the election, I'm guessing.

Punk. — HarleyPeyton (@HarleyPeyton) October 26, 2016 
Still, there were plenty who agreed with Gingrich's suggestion that Kelly was being biased: @DanScavino @megynkelly @realDonaldTrump I used to be a huge fan of Megyn Kelly but no more. Totally unfair to the frmr Speaker. — Scott Schulze (@payshel) October 26, 2016 @DanScavino @megynkelly @realDonaldTrump Send her to CNN.

Since early in the 2016 election cycle, there's no doubt that Kelly and the Trump campaign haven't seen eye-to-eye. 
More recently, it seemed that tensions had cooled between the GOP nominee and the Fox News host. If Scavino's tweet is any indication, however, that may no longer be the story. ",1

64872,WHY SO MANY MILLENNIALS ARE DITCHING RELIGION And Taking Up These Disturbing Trends,"What in the world is going on that young adults are actually taking up astrology and witchcraft WITCHCRAFT??? They ve ditched religion for the occult???Banu Guler, co-founder of artificial intelligence powered astrology app Co Star said the lack of structure in the field is exactly what drives young, educated professionals to invest their time and money in  Astrology.When Coco Layne, a Brooklyn-based producer, meets someone new these days, the first question that comes up in conversation isn t  Where do you live?  or  What do you do?  but  What s your sign? So many millennials read their horoscopes every day and believe them,  Layne, who is involved in a number of nonreligious spiritual practices, said.  It is a good reference point to identify and place people in the world. Interest in spirituality has been booming in recent years while interest in religion plummets, especially among millennials. The majority of Americans now believe it is not necessary to believe in God to have good morals, a study from Pew Research Center released Wednesday found. The percentage of people between the ages of 18 and 29 who  never doubt existence of God  fell from 81% in 2007 to 67% in 2012.Meanwhile, more than half of young adults in the U.S. believe astrology is a science. compared to less than 8% of the Chinese public. The psychic services industry   which includes astrology, aura reading, mediumship, tarot-card reading and palmistry, among other metaphysical services   grew 2% between 2011 and 2016. It is now worth $2 billion annually, according to industry analysis firm IBIS World.UPTICK IN THE OCCULTMelissa Jayne, owner of Brooklyn-based  metaphysical boutique  Catland, said she has seen a major uptick in interest in the occult in the past five years, especially among New Yorkers in their 20s. The store offers workshops like  Witchcraft 101,   Astrology 101,  and a  Spirit Seance. SO CAPITALISM IS AT FAULT? Whether it be spell-casting, tarot, astrology, meditation and trance, or herbalism, these traditions offer tangible ways for people to enact change in their lives,  she said.  For a generation that grew up in a world of big industry, environmental destruction, large and oppressive governments, and toxic social structures, all of which seem too big to change, this can be incredibly attractive.

12082, Spicer Has Epic Freudian Slip During His Half-Assed Apology For Hitler Comments (VIDEO),"Sean Spicer s is having a very, very bad day.While the Jewish community celebrated Passover, Spicer claimed that Adolf Hitler never gassed people. After immediate backlash, Spicer said he meant Hitler never gassed German citizens. After another immediate backlash, Spicer said he meant Hitler never specifically bombed people with chemical weapons, merely gassed them in concentration camps (which he bizarrely called  holocaust centers ). By this point, he had proven his original point was nonsensical and still offensive, while also proving that he was a bad liar.It would take him a few more hours   and a call from the Israeli government asking that he resign  before he got around to begrudgingly apologizing. And he managed to screw that up too.While speaking with CNN s Wolf Blitzer, Spicer claimed he didn t want his Hitler comments to be a  distraction  from Trump s efforts. What efforts exactly? Allow Spicer, seen here stepping on every metaphorical rake in the yard, to explain with characteristic rambling, jumbled sentences:I needed to make sure I clarified and not in any way, shape or form any more of a distraction from the president s decisive action in Syria and the attempts that he s making to destabilize the region.Sean accidentally just said the quiet part loud.

Trump s son Eric would clear things up when he openly admitted Trump impulsively decided to issue the strike after his daughter Ivanka asked him to.Instead, Trump s Middle Eastern efforts continue to be haphazard and counterproductive.

26144, Florida GOPer Wants LGBT Flag Removed Because She Spoke With One Christian Who Found It Offensive,"A rainbow flag raised to honor the LGBT victims in the worst mass shooting in American history is in danger of being removed from the Hillsborough County center in Tampa Bay, Florida, because a Republican official said she talked to a Christian (singular) who said the flag was  unbearable.  Priorities!The pride flag was raised just hours after Hillsborough s commissioners voted 5-1 to hang the flag for the remainder of the month both in acknowledgement of it being Pride Month and in honor of the victims of Orlando, many of whom were LGBT and whose killer was reportedly vehemently anti-gay.Rather than see this as a symbol of unity during the wake of a national tragedy, one Republican commissioner, Stacy White, decided to make this all about fake Christian oppression. Apparently, just seeing the rainbow colors has caused one of her constituents to feel like she can t even drive to work. In an email sent to her fellow commissioners, White complains about how the rainbow flag might be harming those with  strong Christian values. Warning: Her letter is bonkers.My office recently received an anonymous phone call from a county employee stating that, because of her strong Christian beliefs, it will be nearly unbearable for her pass the  pride  flag each morning as she enters the workplace. She clearly indicated that the display of that flag, for her, has created a hostile work environment.My question is, given the nature of this employee complaint, has the board s action taken this past Wednesday created any issues for the county from a Human Resources perspective? If the display of this flag exposes the county any liability whatsoever, I request that it be taken down on the basis that the board s action has violated the workplace rights of some of our employees.White closed her letter out by referring to the Pride Flag as a  divisive, politically-charged symbol  inappropriate for  our workplace. In a country that still routinely displays a flag used in the Civil War to rally around slavery on state property, you may need a microscope and a very steady hand to create a violin small enough to play for White s pity party here. It s also particularly astounding that Republicans can somehow take a hate crime perpetuated on (mostly) LGBT Latinos and somehow make it all about them.Ironically, in the days after the shooting, Republicans shamelessly attempted to leverage the raw emotions of the LGBT community to make the, frankly insulting, pitch that the gay community should vote for Republicans because they could keep them safe from Muslims. The LGBT community, having had decades of experience in picking up on when they are being pandered to, gave the GOP a resounding middle finger and instead demanded America solve a much more dangerous problem: Guns.Apparently, having realized gay people weren t taking the bait, Republicans have reverted back to bashing them instead. Now, just a week after the shooting, Commissioner Stacy White is unflinchingly accusing a symbol of their pride of being  unbearable  to Christians. In several other Republican-dominated counties across America, officials have also refused to honor President Obama s request to lower their flags to half-mast based on technicalities. An obnoxious form of grandstanding meant to signal to their most bigoted voters that they don t really like gay people, so please don t vote them out.Thankfully in Hillsborough at least the other commissioners seem to have an ounce of common decency. Faced with White s pitiable letter, they kindly told her to shove it.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",1
27548,POLITICO DOWNGRADES AMERICA: Declares Germany’s “Open-Borders” Angela Merkel “Leader Of The Free World” In Anti-American Headline,"Here s what Politico s headline today looked like:Here s what the leftist anti-American rag Politico had to say about Angela Merkel s visit to the US to meet with our new President Donald Trump: This time the media hype surrounding a White House meeting is no wild exaggeration. When President Donald Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel finally get together on Friday, the leaders of the West s two most powerful countries are sure to come off more like an odd couple than two close allies chewing over plans for some joint enterprise. And for good reason. Merkel and Trump are not only polar opposites as people, but they share little in terms of international outlook.Their styles reflect their vastly different backgrounds. Merkel, Germany s first and only female chancellor, was raised by a pastor in communist East Germany, where she earned a doctorate in physical chemistry. Although she is the longest-serving and most powerful leader in Europe, she is unfailingly modest, competent and consensus-oriented. Trump s all-about-me mentality, Queens upbringing and brash, tabloid-and-reality-TV personality couldn t be more different. Could one even imagine the outrage if a piece like this was published about Barack Obama within his first 60 days in office? The mentality of the unhinged left is on display for every American to see and if they keep this up, even for a few more months, they will never win another election. Here s how Nigel Farage, the British rock star who was behind  Brexit  feels about Merkel s visit to the White House:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqnCkSYLDgQ",1
14441, The Senate Intelligence Committee Has Bad News For Flynn After He Requested Immunity,"Disgraced former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has asked for immunity in exchange for testifying in the FBI s continuing investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia and he has an answer from the Senate Intelligence Committee. Two Congressional sources told NBC News that the committee declined Flynn s lawyer s request.According to a senior congressional official with direct knowledge of the case, Flynn s lawyer was told it was  wildly preliminary  and that immunity was  not on the table  at the moment. Another source weighed in to say that the committee communicated that it is  not receptive  to Flynn s request  at this time. The senior congressional official added that Flynn s lawyer had conveyed the offer of testimony in exchange for immunity from prosecution to the Justice Department.Alleged president Donald Trump tweeted this morning:Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of historic proportion!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 31, 2017The thought is that either the authorities have nothing on Flynn or they have bigger fish to fry and there s only one person above the former National Security Adviser in this scenario: Donald J. Trump. Or, the evidence already collected on Flynn is damning and they don t need to make a deal   the latter of which is possible.Flynn was fired after lying about speaking with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about Obama-era sanctions. From there, things got worse for Flynn. He also met with Kislyak for about 20 minutes at Trump Tower in December. Just one week later, Flynn registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for $530,000 worth of lobbying work he did before the 2016 election that  could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey. In a statement Thursday, Flynn s lawyer Robert Kelner said no  reasonable person  would get questioned in  such a highly politicized, witch hunt environment without assurance against unfair prosecution. However, in 2016, Flynn was seen at a Trump rally leading  Lock her up!  chants then saying that if he did  one tenth  what Hillary Clinton did, he would be in jail. In addition, on Meet the Press last year, Flynn said,  When you are given immunity, that means that you ve probably committed a crime. Ouchies!

61031,Turkey says recognizing Jerusalem as capital would cause catastrophe,"ANKARA (Reuters) - A formal U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel would cause catastrophe and lead to new conflict in the Middle East, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag said on Monday. Speaking to reporters after a cabinet meeting, Bozdag, who is also the government spokesman, said Jerusalem s status had been determined by international agreements and that preserving it was important for the peace of the region.  The status of Jerusalem and Temple Mount have been determined by international agreements. It is important to preserve Jerusalem s status for the sake of protecting peace in the region,  Bozdag said.  If another step is taken and this step is lifted, this will be a major catastrophe.  Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war. It later annexed it, declaring the whole of the city as its capital   a move not recognized internationally. Palestinians want Jerusalem as the capital of their future state. On Sunday, U.S. President Donald Trump s adviser and son-in-law said Trump had not yet made a decision on whether to formally recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital, a move that would break with decades of U.S. policy. Past U.S. presidents have insisted that the status of Jerusalem   home to sites holy to the Jewish, Muslim and Christian religions   must be decided in negotiations.  On Saturday, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan held a phone call with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in which they discussed the status of Jerusalem, sources in Erdogan s office said.  The sources said Erdogan told Abbas that preserving the status of Jerusalem was important for all Muslim countries, adding that international laws and United Nations decisions should be followed on the issue. Any move by the United States to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital would fuel extremism and violence, Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit said on Saturday. A senior Jordanian source said on Sunday that Amman has begun consultations on convening an emergency meeting of the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation before Trump s expected declaration this week.

Her phone wouldn t stop going off with the persistent buzzing of death threats for her sign, which stylizes the number 45 into a swastika and features Trump posed in a Hitler-esque stance. I m living in a small, podunk red town and I m already getting death threats,  said Lewis, whose store is in right-leaning Chico, population 90,000.  My business has completely floundered.

I have a platform and I m going to use it. Lewis has used the billboard at the corner of Third Avenue and Mangrove Avenue all year, though this is the first time she s made it political. He is not presidential, he is not a president,  Lewis said.  He is a celebrity who was born into money. And he s a Nazi sympathizer. I am going to stand behind my beliefs regardless. Lewis said she has been getting some support, too.Lewis got slammed by bad reviews on her store, Rouse and Revolt Facebook page, as well as her personal Facebook page, where she posted this video.

34106,Trump mounts bid to turn Clinton controversy to his advantage,"PHOENIX (Reuters) - Sensing a potential turning point, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump mounted a furious effort on Saturday to portray Democrat Hillary Clinton as unfit to lead the country after the latest chapter in her email controversy unfolded as he tries to mount a comeback. With the Nov. 8 election only 10 days away, Trump devoted much of his stump speech to try to take the maximum advantage of the FBI’s disclosure that it is investigating more emails as part of a probe into Clinton’s use of a private email server. Little is known about the extent and focus of the new FBI review. But Trump was quick to declare his rival “guilty” at rallies in Phoenix and in Golden, Colorado, declaring that she is symbolic of a type of public corruption that is a “grave threat to our democracy.” Trump charged that the Justice Department, populated by appointees of Democratic President Barack Obama, is trying to help Clinton, given news reports that top department officials did not want FBI Director James Comey to reveal his new review. “When the outcome is fixed, when the system is rigged, people lose hope. They stop dreaming. They stop trying,” Trump said in Phoenix. “Hillary Clinton’s corruption is corrosive to the soul of our nation and it must be stopped.” Clinton herself has repeatedly attacked Trump as not fit to be president. The new uproar could not have come at a more opportune time for Trump, who has been reeling for weeks from the release of a 2005 audio tape in which he boasted about groping women and the emergence of a host of women who said he did just that to them. Trump has narrowed the gap in public opinion polls between him and Clinton nationally and in some battleground states where the election is likely to be decided. But most analyses of the polls show him facing a defeat, perhaps a landslide, if the election were to be held today.  That made it essential for Trump to try to change the subject from his own setbacks and focus on those of Clinton, and give establishment Republicans who have been reluctant to support him a reason to get behind him, and perhaps sway some undecided voters as well. Still, the Phoenix rally provided a reminder why some Republicans cannot bring themselves to support Trump, as a man there taunted reporters with a chant of “Jew S. A.” when the rest of the crowd was chanting “USA.” Trump’s next couple of days on the campaign trail reflect a change in strategy with uncertain rewards. He is to campaign in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on Sunday and in Michigan on Monday,  two states that have voted Democratic in recent presidential elections and appeared poised to do so again. ",0
28585,Study Supports Suspicion That Police Are More Likely to Use Force on Blacks - The New York Times,"The vast majority of interactions between police officers and civilians end routinely, with no one injured, no one aggrieved and no one making the headlines. But when force is used, a new study has found, the race of the person being stopped by officers is significant. The study of thousands of    episodes from police departments across the nation has concluded what many people have long thought, but which could not be proved because of a lack of data:   are far more likely than whites and other groups to be the victims of use of force by the police, even when racial disparities in crime are taken into account. The report, to be released Friday by the Center for Policing Equity, a New   think tank, took three years to assemble and largely refutes explanations from some police officials that blacks are more likely to be subjected to police force because they are more frequently involved in criminal activity. The researchers said they did not gather enough data specifically related to police shootings to draw conclusions on whether there were racial disparities when it came to the fatal confrontations between officers and civilians so in the news. The study’s release comes at a particularly volatile time in the relationship between the police and minority communities after   fatal police shootings of   men this week in Louisiana and Minnesota prompted widespread outrage. Portions of the episodes, both captured on video and released publicly, have intensified calls for police reform as many departments across the nation have been slow to deploy body cameras or to mandate changes in officer training standards after the   deaths of a number of   at the hands of police officers in the past two years.   activists who have demanded greater police accountability since the 2014 fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. set off days of rioting, said Thursday that the study was critical to the conversation, but far from surprising. “It’s kind of like, ‘Is water wet? ’” said Aislinn Sol, organizer of the Chicago chapter of Black Lives Matter. “But what we gain with each study, each new piece of information is that we are able to win people over who are on the fence. The evidence is becoming overwhelming and incontrovertible that it is a systemic problem, rather than an isolated one. ” The organization compiled more than 19, 000    incidents by police officers representing 11 large and midsize cities and one large urban county from 2010 to 2015. It is the sort of data the Obama administration and the Justice Department have been seeking from police departments for nearly two years, in many cases, unsuccessfully. The report found that although officers employ force in less than 2 percent of all   interactions, the use of police force is disproportionately high for    —   more than three times greater than for whites. The study, “The Science of Justice: Race, Arrests, and Police Use of Force,” did not seek to determine whether the employment of force in any particular instance was justified, but the center’s researchers found that the disparity in which   were subjected to police force remained consistent across what law enforcement officers call the    continuum  —   from relatively mild physical force, through baton strikes, canine bites, pepper spray, Tasers and gunshots. “The dominant narrative has been that this happens to   because they are arrested in disproportionate numbers,” said Phillip Atiba Goff, a founder and president of the Center for Policing Equity, based at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. “But the data really makes it difficult to say that crime is the primary driver of this. In every single category, the   disparity persists. ” The study found that the overall mean    rate for all black residents was 273 per 100, 000, which is 3. 6 times higher than the rate for white residents (76 per 100, 000) and 2. 5 times higher than the overall rate of 108 per 100, 000 for all residents. For those who were arrested, the mean rate of use of force against blacks was 46 for every 1, 000 arrests, compared with 36 per 1, 000 for whites. The Obama administration has been nudging police departments to adapt   tactics and to fix broken relationships with poor and minority communities across the nation, which typically experience far more intensive policing because of what are frequently higher crime rates. But because police departments often refuse to release    data that would illustrate such trends, the federal government has had a difficult time in determining whether police departments are employing force less often. The federal government cannot generally compel police departments to hand over such material, and many local agencies say they do not require officers to submit    reports. Other departments say they lack the resources to collect such information, and others acknowledge privately that they fear that the release of their data would subject them to unwanted scrutiny from the public and the federal government. But when the Justice Department has had the ability to review    records, it has found evidence of abuse. In Seattle, federal investigators found that one out of every five    episodes had been excessive. In Albuquerque, the Justice Department determined that most police shootings from 2009 to 2012 had been unjustified. Researchers for the center said Thursday that the compilation of the    material after years of failed efforts to determine whether racial bias was present represented a significant success. The data is so closely held by police departments that the agencies that cooperated with the project did so anonymously. Though the 12 municipalities that provided data were not named, they represented a large urban county in California and 11 cities spanning the nation with populations that range from less than 100, 000 to several million, with an average population of 600, 000. The center said that given the diversity of the municipalities  —   six are predominantly white, one is predominantly black or Latino, and five have populations in which no single racial or ethnic group represents 50 percent or more of the population  —   that the findings are likely to hold true for most other cities. Cameron McLay, the police chief of Pittsburgh, said his agency had been among those to share its    data. He said use of force by his officers had decreased in recent years, but acknowledged that there remained concerns about disparities in use of force when it came to  . “We are responsible for not just bringing down the crime rate, but for making people feel safe in their communities,” he said.",0

70228,Trump on Hurricane Irma: 'This is some big monster',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump called Hurricane Irma “some big monster” as it battered the Florida coast, saying he wanted to go to the state very soon and praising emergency officials for their efforts to protect people. “The bad news is that this is some big monster,” Trump told reporters at the White House, saying damage from the storm would be very costly. “Right now, we are worried about lives, not cost,” Trump said after returning from Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland where he monitored the storm and met with his Cabinet. The path of the storm, tracking the west coast of Florida, meant it might be less destructive than it would otherwise have been, Trump said, noting the next five or six hours would be critical. “I hope there aren’t too many people in the path,” he said. “You don’t want to be in that path.”  The U.S. House of Representatives canceled votes scheduled for Monday because of the hurricane. Trump said the U.S. Coast Guard had been heroic and that the Federal Emergency Management Agency was doing a good job to help coordinate the response with states. He added, however: “I think the hard part is now beginning.” Trump has offered the full resources of the federal government to Florida and the affected states, Vice President Mike Pence told reporters during a visit to FEMA’s Washington headquarters on Sunday. “Wherever Hurricane Irma goes, we’ll be there first,” Pence said. “We’ll be there with resources and support, both to save lives and to help to recover and rebuild these states and these communities.” On Sunday, Trump also issued a disaster declaration for the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, and expanded federal funds available to the U.S. Virgin Islands in the aftermath of Irma, the White House said. Trump owns a resort in Palm Beach, Florida, where he has often traveled during his presidency, as well as three golf courses in the state. He told reporters he hoped to travel to the state soon. “We’re going to Florida very soon,” Trump said. ",0

Israeli troops have razed to the ground at least three houses in the East Jerusalem al-Quds, in the latest demolition of Palestinian property in the occupied territories. 
Local media reported that Israeli forces demolished the buildings in the neighborhoods of Beit Hanina and Silwan on Wednesday without prior notice, displacing at least 44 Palestinians including children. 
The United Nations has documented a dramatic rise in demolitions, saying 124 Palestinians, including 60 children, were left homeless in the occupied West Bank in a single day in April. 
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) also said in August that a total of 726 Palestinian structures had been razed in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem al-Quds since January, and that the demolitions had affected 1,020 Palestinians. 
The world body noted that there were 533 demolitions and 688 displaced Palestinians in the entire 2015, meaning that demolitions so far this year have increased more than 36 percent. This picture taken on March 14, 2011 shows a general view of a construction site in the West Bank settlement of Modiin Illit. (Photo by AP) 
The demolitions have raised alarm among diplomats and human rights groups over Tel Aviv's sustained violation of international law. The demolished structures include houses and schools. 
The Israeli razing of Palestinian homes along with its illegal settlement expansion in the occupied Palestinian territories have dimmed hopes of any peace in the region. 
Over half a million Israelis live in more than 230 illegal settlements built since the 1967 Israeli occupation of the West Bank, including East al-Quds. The settlements are considered by the international community as illegal. 
The occupied territories have witnessed increased tensions ever since Israeli forces imposed restrictions on the entry of Palestinian worshipers into the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in East Jerusalem al-Quds in August 2015. 
Nearly 250 Palestinians have lost their lives at the hands of Israeli forces since the beginning of last October. Loading ...",1
34100, Pregnant Women Infected With Zika TRIPLES While Republicans Refuse Funding In Effort To Hurt Obama,"The party that claims to be  pro-life  sure has a funny way of showing it. This week, the CDC released a dire report on the spread of the devastating Zika virus in the United States which found that the number of confirmed cases in pregnant women has ballooned to 157 in a matter of months. The disease which has only a mild effect on adults has been shown to lead to major birth defects in children, including a major risk of microcephaly.How did Republicans in Congress respond? By underfunding the fight   and then earmarking it for next year (and only if Democrats to agree to slash welfare funding of course).On Tuesday, the Senate cleared the way for expected approval by the chamber on Thursday of $1.1 billion to fight the mosquito-borne Zika virus, which has been linked to birth defects. Unlike the Senate legislation, the House bill requires that the $622.1 million be fully offset with spending cuts elsewhere. Many conservative Republicans in the House refuse to approve Zika funds that would add to federal budget deficits, while Democrats and some Senate Republicans favor treating the problem as an emergency that would not have to be financed with spending cuts.By next year, the number of cases will likely be in the thousands and the already lowball funding will be even less effective. If that sounds like a truly idiotic plan, experts agree and have condemned it. In response to which one Republican whined,  We will have hundreds of millions of dollars in that bill for next year s Zika response, so to suggest that somebody is being shortchanged the money is just being prudently laid out at the appropriate pace and paid for along the way.  (Note:  Hundreds of millions  is less than $1.9 billion.)Is right now really the time to get  serious  about stewardship of the federal deficit?  Absolutely!  say Republicans who may have just realized they only have a dwindling number of months to stick their thumbs in President Obama s eye and can t miss this opportunity.A month ago, a deal was almost hammered out to provide about half of the $1.9 billion Obama had asked for, but that fell through when Republicans tried to use the spending bill to derail the unrelated Iran nuclear deal. When it became clear that Democrats were not going to destroy the historic multinational deal just because Republicans had Zika-infected hostages, the Republicans dropped the bill entirely   and any pretense of actually caring about the victims of Zika. Their new option, put forward by the House GOP, offers just $662 million and is worse than the original in every way; partly because, as mentioned above, it won t even kick in until next year.While Republicans play these games, Dr. Tom Frieden, the director of the CDC, has been emphatically insisting that time is crucial and that defunding other programs to move the money around is monumentally idiotic. You can t rob Peter to pay Paul. That s no way to fight an epidemic,  Frieden said.  Let down your guard in one place, stop fighting one challenge and threat to Americans here to fight it better there   that s not a way to keep Americans safe. Which, of course, is of very little concern to Republicans in Congress. Keeping Americans safe has always taken a backseat to blocking any opportunity for Obama to  win.  If that means putting the lives of thousands of women and their unborn children in jeopardy, well, that s a small price to pay for not having to go back home and look a Tea Party voter in the eye while explaining why he or she worked with the president on anything.If the Zika virus could vote, it would surely support the Republican Party.Featured image via John Moore/Getty Images",1
46863,Clinton says success of Syria agreement rests with Russia,"GREENSBORO, N.C. (Reuters) - Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said on Thursday the success of the Syrian ceasefire brokered by the United States and Russia depends on whether Moscow decides it is in its interest to follow through with the agreement. “Whether or not this works is really up to the Russians,” Clinton told reporters after addressing a campaign rally in Greensboro, North Carolina. “It is up to whether or not Vladimir Putin decides that it’s time to do what the Russians can do to bring this conflict into a period where there can be the beginning of political discussions, a hoped-for protective zone for people who are under relentless assault form the air, and a commitment to going after the terrorist groups that pose a threat to everyone.” ",0
34375,"Syrian, Feared to Be Planning Bombing, Is Arrested in Germany - The New York Times","BERLIN  —   The German police arrested a Syrian man early Monday who was suspected of plotting a bombing, bringing an end to a weekend manhunt that renewed fears about a threat posed by extremists among the nearly one million refugees and migrants who arrived in Germany last year. Federal prosecutors said the suspect, Jaber   22, was believed to be planning “ an   explosive attack in Germany. ” Security officials in the eastern state of Saxony said they had found about three pounds of explosive materials in Mr. Bakr’s apartment, including the same substances as those used in Islamic State attacks in Europe. Jörg Michaelis, head of the state police in Saxony, said that Mr. Bakr had been arrested in Leipzig, in the apartment of other Syrians who had recognized the man from photographs circulated by the authorities over the weekend. The Syrians tied up the suspect and took a photograph of him with a cellphone, which one of them took to a nearby police station, before urging officers to come and arrest him immediately. “Our colleagues with the Leipzig police were able to seize him because his fellow Syrians had already bound and detained him,” Mr. Michaelis said. He declined to provide additional details about the Syrian who led them to Mr. Bakr, citing concerns about his safety. Mr. Bakr, who arrived in Germany in February 2015 and was granted refugee status five months later, had been under surveillance by German security officials for months. A commando unit stormed an apartment on Friday in Chemnitz, about an hour south of Leipzig, where he had been living. In addition, the police found materials that they believe to be TAPT, the same explosive used in terrorist attacks by Islamic State militants in Brussels and Paris last year, Mr. Michaelis said. Thomas de Maizière, Germany’s interior minister, praised the police for arresting the suspect but reminded Germans that the case was further evidence that their country remained in the sights of Islamist terrorists. “The investigation shows that actions as we have seen in France and Belgium cannot be ruled out in Germany,” Mr. de Maizière said. There was no indication of a specific target for the attack, but the authorities searched for two days to find Mr. Bakr, who had slipped away from the state police and special antiterrorism units that raided his apartment after receiving information from the federal authorities. “We are exhausted, but elated: terror suspect Albakr was arrested overnight in Leipzig,” the Saxony police said on Twitter in announcing the arrest. A second suspect, identified by federal prosecutors only as Khalil A. 33, was arrested Sunday and ordered by a judge to be held on suspicion of accessory to plotting an attack. He is suspected of renting the Chemnitz apartment where Mr. Bakr was living and ordering materials for him online. Mr. Bakr was to be brought before a judge on Monday, Mr. Michaelis said. The developments will heighten concern about the extent to which Islamist extremists have exploited Chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision last year to allow asylum seekers to enter the country without more thorough screening. Ms. Merkel, who was traveling in Africa, thanked the Syrians who had detained Mr. Bakr and handed him over to police, her spokeswoman, Ulrike Demmer, said. In July, two men who had arrived as refugees carried out attacks in the southern state of Bavaria, one with an ax and the other with a bomb in a backpack. Those attacks, which wounded 17 people and left the two perpetrators dead, contributed to a growing pushback in Germany toward the refugees, who had arrived to a warm welcome. As the authorities searched for Mr. Bakr over the weekend, they made public a picture of him wearing a black hooded sweatshirt and urged anyone with information on his whereabouts to come forward. The police in Saxony made the appeal in Arabic and English. The authorities were already on heightened alert over the possible threat posed by extremists who may have entered Germany among the 890, 000 people  —   most from Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria  —   who came in 2015 in the hopes of getting asylum. Saxony is home to the   movement known as Pegida  —   the German acronym for Patriotic Europeans Against Islamization of the West  —   and has been the site of some of the most virulent attacks on refugees.",0
16245,Biden rues 'damaging' tone against Mexico in U.S. presidential race,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Joe Biden on Thursday said he felt “almost obliged” to say sorry for verbal attacks on Mexico in the U.S. presidential campaign, in which Republican front-runner Donald Trump has labeled Mexican migrants rapists and drug runners. Speaking alongside Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto during a visit to Mexico City, Biden never mentioned Trump, who nonetheless loomed large over the proceedings. “There’s been a lot of damaging and incredibly inaccurate rhetoric, and I would argue, I feel almost obliged to apologize for some of what my political colleagues have said ... about Mexico, about the Mexican people,” said Biden, a Democrat. Property mogul Trump, who has built up a big early lead in the race to become Republican nominee, has vowed to make Mexico pay for a wall to seal off the United States from its southern neighbor, prompting widespread criticism in both countries. “I just want you to know, Mr. President, that the most heated rhetoric you’ve heard from some of the competitors for the nomination for president, is not who we are as the American people .... It’s the exact opposite,” Biden added. Without naming Trump, Pena Nieto also weighed in, saying “building walls is just isolating oneself.” The 2016 U.S. presidential election is on Nov. 8.     At an event earlier on Thursday, Biden had expressed concern about what the election race said about views held in the United States, calling some of the Republican campaign language “dangerous, damaging and incredibly ill-advised.”  “The message that is coming out of the United States as a consequence of the presidential campaign, about American attitudes toward Mexicans and Mexico generally, (and) the entire hemisphere and our place in the world, is disturbing,” he said. Trump, 69, has vowed to deport the 11 million migrants living illegally in the United States, a position shared by his younger Republican rival, the Texas Senator Ted Cruz.

56462,What to Expect During Juno’s Mission to Jupiter - The New York Times,"With the exception of the sun, Jupiter is bigger than everything in the solar system put together. But little is known about the interior beneath its colorful cloud stripes. Now that Juno has arrived at its destination, it will orbit the planet 37 times over the next 20 months, with the hopes that it will collect data and images that offer clues to the origins of our solar system and the formation of the planets and moons. Several spacecraft have flown past Jupiter, beginning with Pioneer 10 in 1973. NASA’s Galileo spacecraft, entering orbit in 1995, dropped a   probe into Jupiter’s atmosphere, sending back data that showed Jupiter had strong, turbulent winds and offering details about the composition of its atmosphere. During its eight years at Jupiter, Galileo confirmed ideas of how Jupiter’s diaphanous rings formed out of dust particles blasted off Jupiter’s small inner moons. It measured the sizzling   temperatures of volcanoes on Io, one of the planet’s four large moons, and it found evidence of   oceans on the other three moons of Europa, Callisto and Ganymede. Unlike Galileo, Juno will be in an orbit passing over Jupiter’s poles, providing a first close look at those regions. With repeated close passes over the cloud tops, the spacecraft will measure microwave emissions, the gravity field and the magnetic field, offering glimpses into what is deep inside Jupiter. It might seem odd to care about the water on Jupiter, but it is one of the main issues that Juno scientists are focusing on. “That’s in some ways our premier measurement,” said Steven Levin, the mission’s project scientist. On Mars, NASA’s strategy seeks to find out whether there was water there that would have ever made Mars cozy enough for life. Jupiter, with its crushing gravity and   radiation, clearly is not a hospitable place for life, but that’s not why scientists are interested about water there. Rather, the question is, “Where’s the oxygen?” Jupiter has greater concentrations than the sun of most of the heavier elements like nitrogen and carbon, except for oxygen, which is scarce. Thus, scientists expect that oxygen atoms have each been tied up with two hydrogens to form water molecules. The measurements collected by Juno of microwave emissions emanating out of Jupiter will tell both the temperature and how much water there is, because water molecules absorb microwaves. If Juno finds a lot of water, that suggests Jupiter formed farther from the sun in the colder, icier regions and later migrated to its current orbit. Why does Jupiter have more of the heavier elements, anyway? That’s a mystery, too. One hypothesis is that the heavier elements came from comets that crashed into Jupiter and it absorbed them. Does Jupiter have a rocky core at its center? Measuring Jupiter’s gravity field will tell the distribution of mass within. If there is a rocky core, planetary scientists will have to explain how rocky bodies formed that early in the solar system. If there is not, then Jupiter formed out of a collapse of a gas cloud, much as the sun did. Jupiter is almost entirely hydrogen and helium, the two simplest and most abundant elements in the universe. Cool these two gases, and they change to a liquid. Inside Jupiter, hydrogen is believed to undergo another transformation, to a metal. Scientists have not been able to recreate metallic hydrogen on Earth. In laboratory experiments, hydrogen, squeezed to tens of millions of pounds per square inch between two diamonds, has remained stubbornly nonmetallic. The pressure inside Jupiter is hundreds of millions of pounds per square inch. By studying Jupiter’s magnetic fields, probably generated by currents of metallic hydrogen, scientists will receive hints about the properties of this elusive substance. Lots. “I’m confident it’s going to work,” Scott Bolton, Juno’s principal investigator, said before the announcement Monday night that the spacecraft had arrived, “but I’ll be happy when it’s over and we’re in orbit. ” Some of the ways that this could have turned into a bad day: If Juno blew up. In August 1993, NASA’s   Mars Observer spacecraft vanished. An inquiry concluded that a fuel leak caused the spacecraft to spin quickly and fall out of communication. While Juno’s setup is different, there is always a chance of an explosion with rocket fuel. If the engine did not fire at all. The Japanese probe Akatsuki was all set to arrive at Venus in December 2010, but its engine didn’t fire properly, and Akatsuki sailed right past Venus. Last year, Akatsuki crossed paths with Venus again, and this time, using smaller thrusters, it was able to enter orbit. If it crashed into something. Jupiter does not possess the majestic rings of Saturn, but it does have a thin ring of debris orbiting it. Juno passed through a region that appeared clear, but that did not mean it actually was. Even a dust particle could cause significant damage, as Juno was going 130, 000 miles per hour relative to Jupiter. If it flew too close to Jupiter and was ripped to pieces. In one of NASA’s most embarrassing failures, the Mars Climate Orbiter spacecraft was lost in 1999 because of a   between English and metric units. Climate Orbiter went far deeper into Mars’ atmosphere than planned. Juno traveled within 2, 900 miles of Jupiter’s cloud tops, so a miscalculation could have been catastrophic. If the computer crashed. On July 4 last year, the mission controllers of the New Horizons spacecraft that was about to fly by Pluto experienced some nervous moments when the spacecraft stopped talking to them. The computer on New Horizons crashed while trying to interpret some new commands and compressing some images it had taken, the electronic equivalent of walking while chewing gum. The controllers put New Horizons back in working order within a few days, and the flyby occurred without a hitch. For Juno, the scientific instruments have been turned off for its arrival at Jupiter. “We turn off everything that is not necessary for making the event work,” said Dr. Levin, the project scientist. “This is very important to get right, so you don’t do anything extra. ” The intense barrage of radiation at Jupiter could have knocked out Juno’s computer, even though it is shielded in a titanium vault. Usually, when there is a glitch, a spacecraft goes into “safe mode” to await new instructions from Earth, but in this case, that would have been too late to save Juno. The spacecraft had been programmed to automatically restart the engine to allow it to enter orbit. “If that doesn’t go just right, we fly past Jupiter, and of course, that’s not desirable,” Dr. Bolton said. Juno has been executing an automated sequence of actions since Thursday. A timeline of Juno’s arrival (all Eastern time): 9:13 p. m. Start of transmission of single frequency “tones” that will provide updates on the spacecraft’s condition. 9:16 p. m. Juno begins turning away from the sun to position the engine in the right direction to slow the spacecraft for its arrival at Jupiter. 10:41 p. m. With the main antenna pointing away from the sun, Juno switches to a smaller antenna for sending the tones. 10:45 p. m. Juno adjusts itself to eliminate any wobbling. 10:56 p. m. Juno speeds up its spin rate from two rotations a minute to five rotations a minute, a process that takes about five minutes. 11:18 p. m. The main engine begins firing. 11:38 p. m. The spacecraft has slowed down enough to be captured into orbit around Jupiter. 11:53 p. m. The main engine shuts off, leaving Juno in the desired orbit. 11:55 p. m. The spacecraft starts slowing its spin rate back down to two revolutions per minute. 12:07 a. m. Tuesday Juno changes direction to point its antenna back at Earth. 12:11 a. m. Juno ends the transmission of status tones and switches to its   antenna. 12:16 a. m. Juno begins transmitting detailed telemetry, although it may take 20 minutes or longer to lock into the signal. The first two highly elliptical orbits will be 53 days in duration, lasting until  . Then Juno will fire its engine again on Oct. 19 to move to a   orbit when the science measurements begin in earnest. Three   solar panels provide a mere 500 watts to power Juno and its instruments. On Nov. 3, people will be able to start voting on where Juno should point its camera. On the 37th orbit, on Feb. 20, 2018, Juno is to make a suicidal dive into Jupiter, ending the mission, the same way the Galileo spacecraft was disposed in 2003. That is to ensure there is no possibility that Juno would crash into Europa and contaminate it with microbial hitchhikers from Earth. Europa is regarded as one of the most likely places in the solar system to look for life. It took five years to get to Jupiter, and the mission costs $1. 1 billion, yet Juno will have a far shorter stay than the eight years Galileo spent exploring Jupiter in the moons. The close approaches to Jupiter means Juno will pass through intense bombardment of the radiation belts. As the mission progresses, Juno’s orbits will receive more direct hits of radiation. In the best outcome, the mission might be extended for a few months. But over time, the spacecraft’s electronics will fail.",0
46954,Why Comey Reopened the Hillary Investigation (The real reasons),"Posted 10/31/2016 10:54 am by PatriotRising with 0 comments 
This last Friday it became public record that FBI Director James Comey reopened the Hillary Clinton email server investigation after repeatedly testifying before Congress and the world up to last July that he’d closed the case , after in his words not finding sufficient evidence of “any criminal wrongdoing ” to indict her in spite of her four years as Secretary of State egregiously breaching our national security , committing obstruction of justice and willful tampering with evidence, deleting 30,000 emails after receiving a court subpoena constituting destruction of evidence, not to mention repeatedly engaging in perjury before Congress and the FBI. 

But obviously, a federal investigation still in process in late June never stopped serial rapist-crime boss Bill Clinton’s illegal ambush at the Phoenix airport of Comey’s boss US Attorney General Loretta Lynch “clearing” the way for Hillary to proceed without consequence to be anointed as the next US figurehead puppet president by the ruling elite. Because it’s so blatantly obvious to the entire world that Hillary is guilty as sin, Comey’s whitewash didn’t go over well with either Americans or longtime FBI agents who reacted angrily to Comey’s over-the-top corruption. Subsequently, in recent months Comey has had a virtual mutiny on his hands as in the FBI boss has lost all credibility, respect, and moral authority. 

A former federal attorney for the District of Columbia Joe diGenova spelled it all out in a WMAL radio interview last Friday just hours after the news was released that Comey had sent a letter informing Congress that the case is being reopened. DiGenova said that with an open revolt brewing inside the FBI, Comey was forced to go public on Friday with reopening the investigation. The former DC attorney added that the FBI investigators discovered more emails on a phone confiscated from the former New York Congressman and separated husband Anthony Weiner that also included his wife and longtime Hillary’s right-hand woman Huma Abedin’s communications that allegedly bear pertinent relevance to the Hillary case. Funny how things have a karmic way of coming full circle – the Clintons first introduced Weiner and Abedin 15 years ago and they married a half dozen years ago. 

In a separate FBI investigation involving Weiner’s alleged sexting messages with a 15-year old minor , the phone in question was handed over to the FBI. The investigating teams of both the Weiner and Hillary cases compared notes and apparently additional emails not already issued by WikiLeaks or already in FBI possession recently came to light on Weiner’s phone . The legions of rank and file FBI agents were already fuming over Comey’s complete ethical and legal lapses in his choice not to indict Hillary. Joe diGenova believes that FBI personnel forced Comey’s hand to reopen the investigation after giving him the ultimatum that if he failed to do so, the FBI defiantly would. According to diGenova, this latest plot twist only proves that: 

The original investigation was not thorough, and that it was an incompetent investigation. 

Otherwise, had a real investigation been conducted, that Weiner phone used by both Anthony and Huma would have been picked up by the FBI and its contents thoroughly scrutinized long before now. 

In addition to stating the obvious, that the higher-up feds had already made the decision to not consequence Hillary for her crimes, speculating on why that phone was not already submitted to the FBI as evidence, the former DC attorney concluded: 

There could be one explanation: Huma Abedin may have denied that any other phone existed, and if she did, she committed a felony. She lied to the FBI just like General Cartwright , and if she did, she’s dead meat, and Comey knows it, and there’s nothing he can do about it. 

Finally, diGenova dropped one more bombshell in Friday’s interview. An inside source has revealed to him that the laptops belonging to key Clinton aides Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson, both wrongly granted immunity , were not destroyed after all as previously reported, but have been secretly kept intact by investigating FBI agents refusing to destroy incriminating evidence as part of the in-house whitewash. Additionally like their boss, Hillary’s aides also sent classified material using private servers. On top of that, longtime aide Cheryl Mills on multiple occasions has perjured herself lying under oath for the Clinton crime family, tasked with “cleaning up” (aka covering up) their countless scandals over the past several decades. Indeed the whole Clinton entourage not already “mysteriously” winding up in the growing Clinton dead pool are all unindicted criminals protected by the corrosively corrupt DC cronyism where backroom deals (a la Bill’s airport ambush) are brokered based on whatever dirt’s been gathered and used as bargaining blackmail chips against all parties involved. That’s how the Washington crowd stays immune from any and all accountability as well as stays alive. Violate that crime syndicate code of conduct and you lose your life as more recent victims earlier this year have. 

In a “leaked” memo to his FBI that surfaced on Fox Friday night, Comey outlined his reasons for reopening the case in light of the new information the director believes would have ultimately been leaked to Congress and the public anyway. So in full damage control/CYA mode, the beleaguered director now going public really had no choice in the matter. His underlings were chomping at the bit to both out and oust him. In an obvious attempt to weakly claim some moral high ground, Comey wrote in his memo: 

I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record. 

Though his leadership and character are perceived by the vast majority of both FBI personnel as well as American citizens to presently lay in ruin as a pathetically shameful stain and humiliating joke on both the FBI organization and Washington in general, James Comey appears to be feebly attempting to save his own career and reputation for appearing now to “come clean.” But make no mistake, his moral turpitude displayed throughout this Hillary debacle from early 2015 to now has over-exposed him as a total lackey and fraud, so at this late stage of the game, redemption is not even an option. But the criminal misconduct, rampant corruption and diabolical evil committed by those at the highest puppet levels of federal power, and especially the elite puppet masters controlling them, their sins produce far more devastating consequences than this morally lacking man in the middle of this latest controversy. 

Because there is no way that the FBI will properly conclude this part 2 of the Hillary investigation saga before the November 8 th election, Hillary, and her Democrats are predictably crying foul , demanding that the FBI immediately disclose what it has, which of course is a moot point that won’t happen. It seems highly unlikely that the email texts from Abedin and Weiner found on his phone would not contain clear criminal evidence that implicates Hillary. Since Hillary was the globalist choice after Obama was selected in 2008, it seems unlikely that the puppet masters would not permit this latest development to even occur. But then perhaps the ruling elite is pulling the plug on Hillary, concluding that she simply carries too much liability baggage with her deteriorating health condition and never-ending scandals, maybe the globalists are rethinking an alternative replacement like her obnoxiously aggressive VP candidate, the Jesuit-trained and educated Tim Kaine. 

That said, there are some cynics who believe that this recent odd turn is the last ditch desperado attempt being staged to overturn Trump winning by a landslide. This conjectured scenario goes something like this: a few days prior to the election the FBI will once again “clear” Hillary of all charges. This, in turn, would offer her the last minute much needed boost being able to cash in on her worn out persecution complex , plagued forever by her “right wing conspiracy” theory against the “much maligned” woman of destiny. 

In response to all her scandals, Hillary’s M.O. has always been to falsely blame some villainous sinister force. This year it’s been Putin hacking into her emails, and Trump, Putin, and Assange colluding and plotting behind her back. She’s always been as paranoid as Richard Nixon , attempting to deflect the heat she draws from her own skullduggery lies by constantly pointing fingers to externalize blame onto others. It’s a deeply rooted pathological complex that certain tightly screwed sociopaths possess. 

This latest sudden turn of events obviously has James Comey incurring the wrath of Hillary Democrats as well as the Justice Department. By disclosing the reopened investigation so close to the election date that undoubtedly casts some influence on the potential outcome, Comey is defying his AG boss while clearly violating DOJ written policy . Lynch herself even tried to quash Comey’s letter to Congress. But as diGenova alluded, by Comey’s own past misdeeds (and those of his boss and Obama as well), the FBI director placed himself between this rock and a hard place by his own slipshod, half-ass probe failing to acquire Weiner’s phone the first time around. 

The entire sordid affair of this year’s totally rigged political election – pre-fixed in Hillary’s favor – blatantly reveals to America the gross misnomer of the US “justice” system being two-tiered, one for elitist crime cabal bosses like Hillary and the other for the rest of us 99% no longer protected in a totalitarian police state by our once rule of law the US Constitution. Regardless of what happens in the future, the truth genie’s already been let out of the bag, and for eyes open enough to see, it’s floating in the Washington cesspool of filth, debauchery and deception regularly perpetrated by our “entrusted perps” we have as our so called leaders. 

Moreover, this year’s unending batches of Wiki-leaked DNC/Hillary emails and Project Veritas undercover campaign videos confirm that the entire US political, as well as economic system, is morally and financially bankrupt, irreparably broken and in need of complete overhaul. Voter fraud and election fraud are rampant. Soros funded electronic voting machines that are preprogrammed to vote for Hillary are operating in 16 key battleground states. America’s internal house now is in total disarray, badly in need of a deep cleaning purge like never before. Mainstream media is strongly biased against Trump in its blind support for Hillary . As Secretary of State she treasonously sold out our nation, placing us all at high security risk and under foreign interest control at the hands of high rolling bidders so she and her fat cats can get richer as fellow partners-in-crime from places like Saudi Arabia and Israel, destroying our once sovereign country while aiding, abetting, financing and supporting our enemies the global terrorists around the world. She helped create ISIS and plans world war against Russia, China and Iran. The traitors in our government and their globalist puppet masters – the Rothschilds, Rockefellers , the Bushes and Clintons all need to be rounded up, imprisoned and tried at The Hague for both treason and their endless crimes against humanity.

42501,Arrests for Cannabis Possession Outnumber Arrests for All Violent Crimes Combined,"Arrests for Cannabis Possession Outnumber Arrests for All Violent Crimes Combined Nov 5, 2016 1 0 
As the U.S. government continues to fight its futile war on drugs , marijuana possession arrests have now become more common than all other crimes combined , according to a new report focused on showing the human toll of criminalizing drug use and published by Human Rights Watch ( HRW.org ). 
The war on drugs in the U.S. is a palpable failure. Drug-possession arrests more than doubled between 1979 and 2016. The prison population now includes more than half a million Americans jailed for drug offenses , in comparison to only 41,000 in 1980. Over the last four decades, the war on drugs has restricted individual rights and created an environment of violence and inequality, but it has done almost nothing to solve the problems associated with drug abuse. 
“Evaluations of specific tactics, such as raids on crack houses and crackdowns, suggest that their effects on drug availability are minimal, decay rapidly, and may displace drug activity to other areas and increase drug-related violence.” ~ 2016 study published in by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, entitled War on Drugs Policing and Police Brutality Shocking Rise in Cannabis Possession Arrests 
Despite the ongoing war, cannabis usage is becoming more acceptable and even legal, proving that opinion and policy vary wildly. In fact, a study conducted by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism found that the number of Americans who use marijuana has doubled from 2001-02 to 2012-13. The 2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health estimates that over 22 million Americans use the plant either for medical purposes and/or recreationally. 
Americans have become accepting of cannabis, even though it is still illegal under federal U.S. law. Over the last decade, immense amount of research has shown the medical benefits of the cannabis plant . Legalization of the plant in several U.S. states has demonstrated that it is not a threat to public safety. It seems that the most dangerous aspect of cannabis use is the possibility of police confrontation, arrest and incarceration. 
Regardless of the trends showing an increase in cannabis popularity, the report by HRW.org found that policing of marijuana-possession laws continues to be quite aggressive when compared to the enforcement of other laws. 
“Despite shifting public opinion, in 2015, nearly half of all drug possession arrests (over 574,000) were for marijuana possession. By comparison, there were 505,681 arrests for violent crimes (which the FBI defines as murder, non-negligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault). This means that police made more arrests for simple marijuana possession than for all violent crimes combined.” 
Through the evaluation of court data for the state of Texas, HRW discovered that many of those prosecuted “were prosecuted for small quantities of drugs—in some cases, fractions of a gram—that were clearly for personal use.” Other sources reveal that 8 in 10 drug arrests in 2013 were for drug possession rather than sale and manufacturing. Drug Crimes and Prisons 
Every 25 seconds, someone in the U.S. is arrested for drug use or possession. More than one of nine arrests by state law enforcement are for drug possession, amounting to more than 1.25 million arrests per year. 
As a result of this aggressive enforcement of drug laws, on any given day at least 137,000 people sit in local and state jails on drug possession charges awaiting their day in court. Drug possession offenders in general will soon make up 25% of the prison population. Because federal law mandates a sentence of life without parole for anyone whose third strike is a federal crime (such as drug possession and, in many states, marijuana possession), 10 times as many third-strikers are serving time for drug possession as a second-degree murder. 
It’s clear that people from all demographics wish to have safe access to cannabis , both for recreational purposes as well as for a growing list of medical benefits. While access opens up in U.S. states where legalization continues to gain steam, safe access to cannabis is still an issue for many, which is why people are creating businesses like Buy Weed Online Canada , and until the government fully decriminalizes cannabis, our prison system, court system and police forces will continue to be bogged down with the persecution and prosecution of non-violent offenders.

60132,Briton accused of terrorism offences posted picture of Prince George: court,"LONDON (Reuters) - A British man posted a picture of Prince George, 4, and the address of his London school as part of a series of possible targets for Islamist militants, a court heard on Wednesday. Husnain Rashid, 31, is accused of posting information on the Telegram messaging service to encourage jihadis to carry out attacks along with information to help them with possible targets such as stadia.  Prosecutor Rebecca Mundy told London s Westminster Magistrates Court that this included posting a picture of Prince George, son of Queen Elizabeth s grandson Prince William and Kate and destined to be the future king, next to a silhouette of a jihadi fighter. The post included the address of his school in southwest London which he started attending in September and was accompanied with the caption  even the royal family will not be left alone , the court heard. Rashid, from Nelson in Lancashire, northern England, is charged with preparing terrorism acts, which involved plans to travel to Syria to engage in fighting, and preparing to assist others to commit terrorist acts. He did not apply for bail and indicated he would plead not guilty to the charges. He was remanded in custody until Dec. 20 when he will appear at London s Old Bailey central criminal court. ",0
34996,"Under fire, UK's May criticizes Trump curb on refugees","LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May said on Saturday Britain did not agree with U.S. President Donald Trump’s curbs on immigration after facing criticism from lawmakers in her own party for not condemning his executive order. On a visit to Turkey, she was asked three times to comment on Trump’s move to put a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the United States and temporarily barring travelers from Syria and six other Muslim-majority countries, which he said would protect Americans from violent Islamists. She replied Washington was responsible for its policy on refugees.  But later, after her return to London, her spokesman said: “Immigration policy in the United States is a matter for the government of the United States, just the same as immigration policy for this country should be set by our government.   “But we do not agree with this kind of approach and it is not one we will be taking. We are studying this new executive order to see what it means and what the legal effects are, and in particular what the consequences are for UK nationals.” Trump’s executive order plunged America’s immigration system into chaos, with legal U.S. residents being turned away at airports, and drew criticism from U.S. Western allies including France and Germany. May, who became the first foreign leader to meet the president following his inauguration last week, had been enjoying a positive response at home for revitalizing the “special relationship” between the United States and Britain. But her response while in Ankara for talks with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan triggered criticism from her party. “Trump really is a sickening piece of work,” lawmaker Sarah Wollaston, a member of May’s Conservative Party, said on Twitter. She said Trump should be snubbed by parliament when he comes for a planned state visit to Britain later this year. “I don’t care how special the relationship is, some lines just shouldn’t be crossed,” Conservative lawmaker Heidi Allen said in a tweet. “Strong leadership means not being afraid to tell someone powerful when they’re wrong. It’s an ethos this country is proud of.” A third Conservative member of parliament, Nadhim Zahawi, said he would be banned from the United States as a British citizen of Iraqi origin. “A sad sad day to feel like a second class citizen,” he tweeted. “Sad day for the USA.” Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, said May should have stood up to Trump. “It should sadden our country that she chose not to,” he said.

61919,OBAMA LIED To Protect Hillary..New Wikileaks Email Proves It!,"Remember Combetta is Hillary s Oh Sh*t IT guy:BREAKING: FEMALE LAW STUDENT Busts Hillary s  Oh Sh*t  IT Guy Who Was Seeking Help To Scrub Hillary s Name From Emails Wikileaks Applauds!The same day that President Barack Obama publicly insisted that he learned about Hillary Clinton s use of private email for government business from news reports, internal campaign emails show that Clinton staffers knew he wasn t telling the truth.Obama was asked by CBS in March 2015 when he learned about Clinton s use of  an email system outside the U.S. government for official business  as Secretary of State.  The same time everybody else learned it, through news reports,  he responded.In a hacked March 7, 2015 email released by WikiLeaks Tuesday, Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin highlighted Obama s comments in an email to other staffers.  You probably have more on this, but it looks like POTUS just said he found out HRC was using her personal email when he saw it in the news,  he said.Clinton s former chief of staff at the State Department Cheryl Mills immediately followed up in a private email to campaign chairman John Podesta.

5929, Target Women’s Bathroom Is Bombed Amid Transphobic Right-Wing Protests (VIDEO),"Police are investigating a possible hate crime after a bomb went off inside a women s restroom in Target.On Wednesday, law enforcement responded to the Target retail store in Evanston, Illinois after a small explosive device went off inside the women s bathroom. No one was hurt and the damage was minor, but authorities are looking into whether or not this was a hate crime.According to WGN:Early indications are that a plastic bottle was used but no projectiles like nails or tacks were inside it. Investigators are gathering evidence including examining store security camera video.For months, conservatives have been viciously protesting the retail giant over the decision to let transgender customers use the bathroom that corresponds to their gender identity.An online petition to boycott Target has been signed by over 1 million people and right-wingers have literally entered the store to harass employees and customers with annoying religious rhetoric and hate speech.Here s the video via WGN.The hate against the LGBT community has reached fever pitch in many red states, where Republicans have passed and enacted discriminatory laws allowing business owners to refuse service to LGBT people if they have a  sincere religious belief. It would certainly not be surprising if the perpetrator of this bombing ends up being a disgruntled right-wing bigot. After all, they are the only one obsessed with stopping people from using the women s bathroom and this bomb certainly achieved that goal, albeit temporarily.Conservatives certainly better hope that one of their own rabid extremists isn t responsible for this act of terrorism.Because if that turns out to be the case, then right-wing nut jobs would have proven themselves far more dangerous to women s safety in bathrooms than transgender people have ever posed since there has not been one instance of a transgender person sexually assaulting a woman in the bathroom across the 17 states and over 200 cities that have protections in place for transgender people.Featured image via screen capture",1
6757, WATCH: Michael Steele CALLS OUT Trump For Attacking Civil Rights Icon Rep. John Lewis,"Former RNC chair Michael Steele did not mince words when he called out Donald Trump on Saturday.Rep. John Lewis, who nearly sacrificed his life fighting for voting rights in Selma, Alabama during the Civil Right Movement, remarked on Friday during an interview with Chuck Todd that he doesn t believe Trump is a legitimate president. I believe in trying to work with people,  Lewis said.  It will be hard. It s going to be very difficult. I don t see this president-elect as a legitimate president. Of course, Trump s ego couldn t handle the truth so he lashed out in the most embarrassing way.Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2017mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. All talk, talk, talk   no action or results. Sad!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2017Trump literally accused Lewis of being  all talk  and  no action. Unlike Trump, Lewis has spent his life fighting for equality and civil rights. He was even nearly beaten to death for it. Meanwhile, Trump has never fought for a damn thing except for himself.Trump s attack on Lewis also coincides with Martin Luther King Day weekend, which made his attack all the more offensive, and Steele put Trump in his place during an appearance on MSNBC. Number one, don t tweet that. Number two, don t go there. And number three, try and step back and appreciate what s being said,  Steele advised Trump.  You can put it in a partisan context. You know,  He s a Democrat, I m a Republican. He s black, I m white.  It goes to what you were just saying, what s undergirding that? Steele then reminded Trump that if he really wants to heal wounds and bridge divides that he needs to include African-Americans. Instead, Trump just widened that divide by attacking a civil rights legend. If you re looking to heal and bridge, and bring people of America together, well, we re a part of that. As black folks, we re apart of that. Our expectation is, not only will you attempt that same effort that you would to white folks in other communities, but that you will show respect for our leadership, those who do represent our interests. You know, the tweet is unnecessary. John Lewis has a walk that very few people in this country, least of all Donald Trump, have ever walked. In short, Lewis walked the walk while Trump does nothing but talk.Here s the video via Twitter. John Lewis has a walk that very few people in this country, least of all Donald Trump, have ever walked.  #AMJoy https://t.co/L3WtLNCfNs  Keith Boykin (@keithboykin) January 14, 2017Donald Trump has done nothing but divide this nation since his ugly campaign began.

29558,Representative Conyers' future plans to be discussed in 'next day or so': attorney,"DETROIT (Reuters) - The question of whether U.S. Representative John Conyers may resign in the face of sexual harassment allegations will be addressed in the “next day or so,” an attorney for the congressman said on Friday. “We will make another announcement in the coming days as to whether the congressman will continue or whether he will step aside, but that decision is not being made today,” attorney Arnold Reed told reporters outside Conyers’ home as he discussed the allegations. Conyers, who is facing an investigation by the House Ethics Committee, is one of numerous prominent men in U.S. politics, media and entertainment who have been accused in recent months of sexual harassment and misconduct. Others include former Hollywood executive Harvey Weinstein, Democratic Senator Al Franken and Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore. Conyers has acknowledged settling with one former staffer over her claims of harassment, but he has denied wrongdoing. He has relinquished his post as the senior Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee and has said he will cooperate with the ethics probe. Representative Nancy Pelosi, the leading Democrat in the House of Representatives, and her top deputies on Thursday had called on Conyers to step aside. House Speaker Paul Ryan, the top-ranking Republican in Congress, also said Conyers should resign. Reed said he had spoken with Conyers about his future before the congressman went into the hospital on Wednesday after experiencing dizziness, shortness of breath and lightheadedness, but that Conyers had not reached a definitive decision. “No decision has been made at this juncture,” Reed said. “As you know, his health is not the best,” he said. “We will meet in the next couple days, if he gets stronger, which I anticipate he will, so that we can discuss these issues.” ",0
19931,Trump Halts Travel In New Executive Order,"21st Century Wire says After President Donald J. Trump s previous visa suspension was blocked by federal courts, he has fulfilled his vow to overturn this by introducing a new Executive Order temporarily blocking travel to the US for residents of six Muslim-majority countries pending revision of visa procedures. The order halts the issuance of new US visas to citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen for the next 90 days.The new Executive Order was revealed to reporters today by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Due to increased co-operation between the Baghdad and US governments on background checks of applicants, Iraq is excluded from the Order.More on this report from Russia Today  RT  President Donald Trump has issued a new executive order, temporarily blocking travel to the US for residents of six Muslim-majority countries pending revision of visa procedures. The previous travel ban, issued in January, was blocked in federal courts.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the new executive order to reporters on Monday.The order halts the issuance of new US visas to citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen for the next 90 days.Iraq, which was included in the January ban, was left off the list this time after the government in Baghdad agreed to increase cooperation with the US on background checks for its citizens applying for visas, AP reported.Iraqi Foreign Ministry spokesman Ahmed Jamal called the decision  an important step in the right direction  that  consolidates the strategic alliance between Baghdad and Washington in many fields, and at their forefront the war on terrorism. Tillerson thanked the government in Baghdad for working with the State Department on improving vetting, and called the order  a vital measure for protecting our national security. The new order also imposes a 120-day halt on refugee admissions from the six countries. Legal permanent residents ( Green Card  holders) from the countries will not be affected, however, Reuters reported citing a fact sheet supplied by the administration. Nothing in this executive order affects existing lawful permanent residents,  Kelly said, adding that Homeland Security will enforce it  humanely, respectfully and with professionalism.  Trump s senior aide Kellyanne Conway provided confirmation in an interview with Fox News on Monday.

34940,The Trump Recession: He’s linked himself to potential economic calamity with Brexit stance,"Back in March, some of the financial sector’s leading analysts bumped the chances of a global economic recession from 20 percent to 30 percent. The chances are still minuscule, but the danger always looms. And given the tragic consequences of the Great Recession, any new indicators leading to another potential recession ought to be met with, at the very least, a tone of seriousness. Today, with the Brexit referendum passing in favor of leaving the European Union, and the subsequent decline in the British pound and, specifically, worsening indicators leading toward a British recession, there’s renewed fears of the Brexit shockfront crushing neighboring economies as well.

In the United States, meanwhile, the Republican position on Brexit seems to be based upon everything except the economic repercussions. Instead, the GOP’s posture appears to be simply blurting the opposite of whatever President Obama and the Democrats have to say about it. Indeed, the standard for any GOP argument since 2008 has been, simply put, Opposite Day. If Obama’s for it, they’re against it — even if Obama’s position was once a GOP position (the individual mandate, NSA metadata collection, predator drones, immigration reform, cap-and-trade, and the list goes on). While the GOP never really supported Brexit, they should have, especially knowing that the E.U. was one of the U.S.’s signature achievements after World War II, further assuring there aren’t continued world wars as the atomic age began. Beyond that, the possibility of a Brexit-induced recession should’ve frightened them away. However, we’re assuming the GOP is driven by rational policy choices in 2016. It’s not.

Donald Trump, for his part, isn’t interested in the justifications for, or the post-war history of Europe. He’s only really interested in taking a position because, as with his party, it’s the opposite of Obama’s and Hillary’s. Had he been less driven to blurt a reaction to a potentially cataclysmic event — an event that he was totally unfamiliar with just a month ago, and if he had thought through a strategy that was a slightly more detailed than the 140 character limit on Twitter, he would’ve picked up on a golden opportunity to link Hillary and the Obama administration to a forthcoming recession, regardless of whether it was precipitated by Brexit.

This week, while appearing on stage with Elizabeth Warren for the first time, Hillary Clinton accurately observed that the Wall Street fallout from Brexit cost Americans around $100 billion, all of which vanished when the markets reacted to the Trump-supported Brexit vote:

Average Americans weren’t the only people impacted by Trump’s beloved Brexit vote. Around 400 of his fellow billionaires (if you believe what he says about his net worth) worldwide lost $196.2 billion due to the “leave” vote. This is what Trump supports? Weird. At the very least, experts at Goldman-Sachs are foreseeing a decline in the U.S. economy from around 2.25 percent growth to two-percent straight up. Britain itself appears to be poised for a recession late this year or in early 2017. Nevertheless, Trump missed a fantastic opportunity to sidestep the Brexit vote and, therefore, to fully blame a would-be recession on Hillary Clinton and her allies in the Obama administration. Instead, if Brexit continues to disrupt the world economy, he’ll absolutely remain on-record as having supported the spark that touched off the decline. Simultaneously and moving forward, Hillary can easily marry Trump to Brexit and brand the downturn as the “Trump Recession.” Conversely, had Trump kept his self-defeating mouth shut and, perhaps, continued to mock disabled people — you know, because he has “the best words” — he could’ve solely linked Hillary and Obama to the recession, without even mentioning Brexit as an inciting incident. But, once again, Trump stepped into the pitch and, for no real political gain, took a fastball to the side of his clown-wigged noggin. Sure, Trump is politically astute enough to realize that playing Opposite Day politics plays well with his brainwashed cult-like base. They’re with him no matter what, so, in the near-term it shouldn’t matter. After all, another feature of modern GOP strategy is political expedience over long-term gains. Trump’s got a lock on around 30 percent of American voters, but he’s clearly underestimating the number of Republicans, like George Will, Glenn Beck or Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), who are easily capable of sidestepping a vote for Trump and supporting someone — anyone — else, not to mention the scores of moderate undecided voters. The question moving forward is whether Trump is capable of making any winnable political choices, given how he’s vowed to “have so much winning, you may get tired of winning.” Instead of positioning himself to immediately link Hillary to a sputtering economy, he’s linked himself to it. He’s, in effect, dropped the ball on two issue areas that are normally owned by the GOP: the economy and national security. According to the new ABC News / Washington Post poll, Obama’s approval on the economy is hovering around 55 percent, while Hillary has been seen more favorably than Trump on her reaction to Orlando. If Trump can’t win on these issues, he might as well give up. And I’m not sure he hasn’t.",0
39415,ELECTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES: MUSLIM MAYOR Makes NJ City A Sanctuary City: “No City Funds Or Resources Shall Be Used To Assist In The Enforcement Of Federal Immigration Law”,"Nothing says respect for America and for your elected office like using an executive order to make it easier for people who entered our country illegally to break the law without fear of persecution Watch for the political stock of Mohamed Khairullah, the Syrian-born Mayor of Prospect Park, to rise in Democratic circles after he signed an executive order on Friday that declared the Passaic County borough of 5,865 a sanctuary for immigrants.Hailing from Aleppo, which has become synonymous with the worst violence of the long Syrian civil war and has thus created tens of thousands of refugees, Khairullah immigrated to the United States in 1991, was elected Councilman in 2001, and has been the Mayor since 2006.Khairullah directly refers to his own past in explaining why he signed the order:  It is important to me as a person who came to the U.S as an immigrant, that we uphold our laws and values,  he said Saturday, according to NJ.com.  The U.S is the land of opportunity and dreams for many people all over the world. The heightened profile for Khairullah, a former teacher in the Paterson public schools who worked at Office Depot, represents growing political power for Muslims in New Jersey politics.Seven weeks ago, Passaic County elected its first Muslim Freeholder when Assad Akhter, a deputy chief of staff to U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell and the son of Pakistani immigrants, took of the seat of Hector Lora. Lora resigned to become Mayor of Passaic.   Observer NJ",1
59349, Costco Raises Minimum Wage For Workers As Republicans Continue To Do Nothing,"Costco cares more about the American workforce than Republicans do.A few years ago, Costco answered the call to help struggling workers by raising the wages of their own employees to $12 an hour, nearly a full $5 increase above the federal minimum wage that House and Senate Republicans refuse to raise for the rest of the American people.The results swiftly proved that rewarding your employees and increasing their morale is a good business decision that propels a company forward and turns it into a more competitive one.As other corporations like Walmart saw sales sink, the quarterly income of Costco soared ahead.And now Costco is betting on their employees again by raising their wages by another dollar per hour.Costco announced the wage hike on Thursday in a move that could affect a large number of the 117,000 employees who work for the company.The move not only appears to be Costco s way of rewarding their employees, it appears to also be an answer to Walmart s grudging decision to raise wages for their own workers earlier this year.By raising wages for their own employees, Costco is competing with Walmart to draw new applicants as well as retain current workers.But Costco, unlike Walmart, has always treated their employees with dignity and respect.According to the Huffington Post,Costco has a reputation for being one of the better low-wage employers. It pays slightly more than its competitors (even before the wage increase), closes its doors for major holidays like Thanksgiving and Independence Day and provides health benefits to most of its employees, even those who make an hourly wage.Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress continue to refuse to raise the federal minimum wage to help all American workers across the nation, which has resulted in states and cities raising wages on their own to address the struggle minimum wage workers have faced for decades.Most recently, the state of Oregon passed the highest minimum wage in the nation. In the next few years, Oregonians can expect to make up to $14.50 per hour, which is double the federal minimum wage.Now if only Republicans would stop obeying orders from their corporate masters, perhaps the rest of the American people could get the raise they need to take better care of their families without having to struggle near as much. Alas, it will probably require replacing them with Democrats to make it happen.Featured image from Wikimedia",1

39707, Trump And His ‘Law And Order’ AG Sign Executive Orders Giving Cops Power To Shoot Black People,"Police violence against people of color is a huge problem in America. The worst part of it is that these people almost never even make it to trial, much less get convicted. It s a horrific pattern of abuse and state-sanctioned murder that seems to have no end in sight. Well, tragically, under Donald Trump and his new racist Attorney General Jeff Sessions, things are about to get a whole hell of a lot worse.As soon as Sessions was sworn in, he stood with Trump as they announced three new executive orders giving cops even more power to murder with impunity and without consequence. Citing the  threat of rising crime  and  public safety  as his justifications, Trump just signed the death warrants of many more people of color at the hands of police. Trump says of the orders: I am directing the Department of Justice to reduce crimes and crimes of violence against law enforcement officers. It s a shame, what has been happening to our great, our truly great, law enforcement officers. That is going to stop today. Trump went on to basically threaten people with the orders, saying he was sending a  clear sign  to anyone who might put a toe out of line. He said to the would-be criminals: Your day is over. A new era of justice begins and it begins right now. One of the documents is said to define new federal crimes, and increase penalties for existing federal crimes, in order to prevent violence  when it comes to cops getting shot. Of course, they had nothing to say regarding the scores of people who are killed by cops with no justification whatsoever. To compare, 2016 saw 135 cops killed, while 968 people were killed BY cops. So, yeah, the real problem here is violence, sure, but it s not against the police.Trump and Sessions know good and damn well who they are targeting here. It s not people who look like them or their kids. It s people of color who are often stopped by police for no good reason whatsoever.Let s face it   this will lead to more murder by cop and mass incarceration of people of color, which is, of course, exactly what racists like Donald Trump and Jeff Sessions want.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",1

37086,"Nomi Prins: Too Big to Fail, Hillary-Style","Here's something interesting from The Unz Review... Recipient Name Recipient Email => 
Donald Trump has long campaigned on the promise of running the country the way he’s run his businesses. On that basis, we essentially already know what it would mean if he entered the Oval Office and applied his personal business acumen to this nation (and the rest of the world). There’s a surprisingly full record to cite. Who can forget, for instance, what happened to his signature gambling resorts in Atlantic City? Who can forget their serial failures in what was still relatively good times in that city, including the repeated trips to bankruptcy court and the way he stiffed local contractors and suppliers, running them out of business? As Russ Buettner and Charles Bagli of the New York Times summed it up : “He put up little of his own money, shifted personal debts to the casinos and collected millions of dollars in salary, bonuses, and other payments. The burden of his failures fell on investors and others who had bet on his business acumen.” 
In his pre-political years, he perfected what Kurt Eichenwald of Newsweek dubbed “the art of the bad deal”: “lost contracts, bankruptcies, defaults, deceptions, and indifference to investors.” And from every bad deal for those who supported him, he’s almost always walked away better off. All in all, it’s quite a record (and don’t even mention Trumped Up University ). There is no reason to believe that this pattern of behavior would change in the White House. After all, The Donald’s record shows a remarkable consistency, so it’s possible to imagine with a fair degree of accuracy what you’re going to get. 
Take election night 2012 when The Donald was still a Mitt Romney supporter. CNN recently reported on his tweets that night and judging by his comment on the Chinese invention of climate change, his complaints about polling violations, his outburst about “sham” elections, and in the wake of Romney’s loss his call for “revolution,” there hasn’t been much truly new under the Trumpian sun in 2016 — not even his last tweet of that night four years ago: “We have to make America great again!” In other words, his record should be considered remarkably predictive. So count on this: from the Oval Office, he’ll walk away a richer man, leaving the rest of us holding the bag, and his supporters, particularly white working class men, in a striking version of hell. 
Then, of course, there’s the other candidate. You know who — the woman who never saw a bank CEO she couldn’t get a couple of hundred thousand dollars from for giving thoroughly unsurprising speeches. Today, TomDispatch regular Nomi Prins, author of All the Presidents’ Bankers , explores what our world might be like if The Donald goes down in flames and Hillary Clinton enters the White House next January. Consider this, economically speaking, the definition of a hold-onto-your-hats election, no matter who wins.

44009,How the Obama White House runs foreign policy,"When Susan E. Rice took over as President Obama’s national security adviser two years ago, she was struck by how the White House had grown. Since she had last served on the National Security Council, during the Clinton administration, its staff had nearly quadrupled in size, to about 400 people.

Earlier this year Rice embarked on an effort to trim that number, hoping to make the policy­making process more agile. By mid-July, she said in an interview, the staff had been cut by 6 percent.

But it may be too late to change impressions of an NSC bureaucracy whose size has come to symbolize an overbearing and paranoid White House that insists on controlling even the smallest policy details, often at the expense of timely and effective decisions.

In the Defense Department, where mistrust of the White House has persisted since the administration began, Obama is described as resolute and bold when a quick executive action is needed on operations such as hostage rescues and targeted captures and killings.

However, when the president has wanted to move swiftly on some of his most ambitious policy initiatives — the opening to Cuba and the early Iran nuclear negotiations — he has circumvented the usual practice for decision-making and kept a close hold within the White House.

Two senior NSC officials — deputy national security adviser Benjamin J. Rhodes and then-Latin American director Ricardo Zuniga — handled secret talks leading to last December’s announced opening to Cuba. The White House did not inform Secretary of State John F. Kerry until the discussions were well underway, and State Department officials in charge of the region found out only as they neared completion.

The success of those policies — along with a climate deal with China, trade agreements and other legacy-building achievements in recent months — have boosted internal morale and for some, at least, validated the way the administration operates.

But on a host of other important issues, the NSC, designed in Harry Truman’s time to coordinate sometimes-conflicting diplomatic and defense views, is still widely seen as the place where policy becomes immobilized by indecision, plodding through months and sometimes years of repetitive White House meetings.

In addressing challenges where there is internal disagreement or there are no good options — civil war in Syria, Russians in Ukraine and military dictatorship in Egypt, for example — policymaking has been “sclerotic at best, constipated at worse,” a senior Defense Department official said.

“Time seems to be all this process produces. More time, more meetings, more discussions,” the official said.

Others fume that the NSC has taken over things that could and should be handled elsewhere in the government. Former CIA director and defense secretary Leon Panetta, who left the administration in February 2013, has spoken of the “increasing centralization of power at the White House” and a “penchant for control” that in his case included submission of speeches and interview requests for White House approval.

His predecessor at the Defense Department, Robert M. Gates, has said that “micromanagement” by the Obama White House “drove me crazy.”

Many inside Cabinet departments and agencies complain that their expertise and experience is undervalued and that they are subjected to the whims of less knowledgeable NSC staffers. With such a large structure that in some areas duplicates their own departments, senior officials see the NSC as usurping their responsibilities, leaving them feeling unappreciated and frustrated.

“If assistant secretaries, deputy assistants, don’t have a sense of authorship and accountability, they tend to get beaten down,” said a recently departed high-level administration official. “When large agencies — the Defense Department or State or others — don’t feel as much a part of the takeoff, implementation tends to suffer. It’s just human nature.”

Others are less diplomatic. “Any little twerp from the NSC can call a meeting and set the agenda,” a senior State Department official said.

More than a dozen current and former senior officials in national security departments and agencies, and in the White House, discussed the NSC for this article, some of them in several interviews. Most spoke only on the condition of anonymity, whether to criticize or to praise.

Outside the administration, some lawmakers, policy experts and scholars charge that a bloated NSC staff, filled with what they describe as acolytes who distrust the rest of the government and see protecting the president as their primary job, has helped make Obama’s foreign policy ineffective and risk-averse.

“There are problems that call for a real ‘whole of government’ solution,” said David Rothkopf, who has written extensively on the history and structure of the National Security Council and served in the Clinton administration. “I’ve never seen an administration that says it more and does it less.”

Grumbling about how the White House operates is far from unique to the Obama administration, and the NSC staff has grown substantially under virtually every successive president since Jimmy Carter. But the size and intrusiveness of Obama’s NSC has made it a prominent target.

The White House thinks that some administration officials blame the NSC to disguise disorganization and disagreements within their own departments or when decisions don’t go their way.

“I’m not saying there isn’t micromanagement at the NSC. There is,” Rhodes said.

But “sometimes I think the NSC just becomes kind of the boogeyman.”

Never getting to yes or no

“This will likely piss everybody off,” Obama observed at a national security meeting last March, when he decided to end an 18-month long internal argument by releasing weapons shipments to Egypt.

The arms — F-16 aircraft, Abrams tank components and Harpoon missiles — had been on hold since the July 2013 military overthrow of elected president Mohamed Morsi and the installation of Gen. Abdel Fatah al-Sissi as president.

Several months of debate ensued over whether to call the military action a coup — a designation that would have required all military assistance to be withheld. The White House decided to leave its options open.

Some assistance would continue while major military items would be withheld as a message of disapproval. Obama ordered a review of the overall U.S. aid relationship with Egypt, a strategic ally in the Middle East, and said the full partnership would not be restored until Sissi took steps toward a sustainable, nonviolent democracy.

As the review dragged on for months, internal frustration grew.

Kerry and then-Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel argued that the United States needed Egypt as a reliable, well-armed ally in the region and should restore the weapons aid. Partner nations in the Persian Gulf region — already stung by Obama’s refusal to take military action in Syria — warned that the administration was alienating the Egyptians when it should be working with them.

Others, including departmental officials under both Kerry and Hagel, along with Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power and outside human rights advocates, took a different view. They insisted that Obama needed a sign from the Egyptians: some indication they were prepared to stop rounding up political opponents and journalists, release the ones they had thrown in jail, and stop dealing with dissent by killing and execution.

By the time Obama decided in March to lift the ban on the planes and other big-ticket items, no one’s view had changed. Little to nothing had been gained on the human rights front. Sissi’s distrust for the administration had deepened, and Persian Gulf partners thought that the administration had once again let them down.

To many on the inside, Egypt policy has been a prime example of the NSC’s failure to bring together disparate Cabinet views and fashion options for timely presidential decision.

The White House sees different phenomena at work, including the inability of Cabinet secretaries to marshal unity within their own departments, and resentment on the losing side. On both Egypt and Ukraine, where there has been similar reluctance to make final decisions, there has been “a lateral difference between principals” and those beneath them, a senior official said. “Both are sets of issues where decisions have had to go directly to the president and where the decisions haven’t always been popular.”

“We’re working to fix it,” the official said. “It’s everybody’s problem. It frustrates everybody.”

Some remain unsatisfied, however. A senior State Department official recently described White House meetings held four or five days a week on an issue of current concern, with little turnaround time to prepare ordered documents or consider what was discussed the day before. Often, the meetings amount to time-wasting repetition of the same arguments.

In another example, the Justice Department indicated in a high-level meeting last summer that a proposal to hold in indefinite detention older children who crossed the Mexican border without their parents was likely illegal. Yet the same proposal appeared repeatedly on the agenda for discussion by ever-more senior officials, eventually rising to Obama — who pointed out that in addition to being unwise, it was likely illegal, a participant said.

On some issues, meetings at the level of Cabinet deputies — the place where options are supposed to be refined before consideration by department heads and then the president — grew so repetitive last year that deputies stopped coming, sending assistant secretaries and below in their stead.

“It was like ‘Groundhog Day’ . . . with no progress, no refinement,” said one official. “In fairness, these are all tough questions. But eventually, you’ve got to make a choice.”

A former White House official said: “The thing I think is fundamentally wrong with the NSC process is that there’s too much process. There’s too much airing of every agency’s view and recommendations, and not enough adjudicating. . . . Someone’s got to be the decision-maker, who’s just going to say, ‘We’re going to do this’ and ‘We’re not going to do that.’ ”

Crucial delays can be as much about what a policy will look like as about what it actually is. During NSC-led meetings early last year over Ukraine’s list of requested military assistance, “most items were seen as ‘too military,’ ” a senior Defense Department official said. “We were not sure how far Russia was going to go” in helping a separatist takeover, “and whether this would provoke them.”

The Ukrainian military’s urgent need for blankets and packaged meals was easily agreed at the start. The question was how to get them there.

Over multiple NSC meetings, “there was a lot of discussion about optics,” the official said, and whether to send the items by military cargo aircraft or overland.

Eventually, it was decided to ship the supplies by European-licensed trucks, to avoid the provocative sight of U.S. military transport planes on the ground. But a few weeks later, this official flew into Kiev airport for a meeting with Ukrainian officials, only to spot several large, grey C-130 U.S. military transports on the runway. Vice President Biden was visiting, and the planes were there to deliver his communications equipment and sensitive gear.

“Things like that color moods and sour people,” the official said of the lengthy debates. “When you litigate all the small stuff, it makes the big stuff even worse.”

Debates over Ukraine’s request for heavy weapons have now gone on for well more than a year. The White House has not said yes, but it has never said no.

Established in the years following World War II to help the president coordinate and reconcile diplomatic and military perspectives, the National Security Council initially included only the president and the secretaries of state and defense. Since the Truman administration, each chief executive has added, or on rare occasions subtracted, seats at the head table.

A small secretariat eventually developed into a presidential staff led by the national security adviser. Different presidents have put the staff to different uses, but virtually all have increased its size, and the staff itself is now more commonly known as “the NSC.”

Jimmy Carter managed with about 25 NSC staffers and a powerful and outspoken national security adviser in Zbigniew Brzezinski, who often eclipsed Cabinet secretaries. Ronald Reagan went through six national security advisers in eight years, and an “operational” NSC that led to fiascoes such as the Iran-contra scandal.

Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser to George H.W. Bush, is often cited as the “gold standard” for how to run an effective and collaborative NSC. Concerned that its staff would overwhelm the departments, he limited it to 50 people.

Its purpose was to integrate views and create a cohesive national security policy, Scowcroft said in an interview, “not to replace departments. . . . That’s always the instinctive thing — well, ‘These guys aren’t doing a good job on something, we’ll just do it ourselves.’ I tried not to do that.”

Under Bill Clinton, the NSC doubled in size to about 100. George W. Bush doubled it again, to 200.

The first indication of how Obama planned to use the NSC came with Presidential Policy Directive 1, issued three weeks after his inauguration. Following the Scowcroft structure, it established a Principals Committee of Cabinet secretaries and top agency officials, chaired by the national security adviser, as the last stop before policy options reached the president.

The Deputies Committee, of No. 2 agency officials, analyzes issues and options before they reach the principals, handles day-to-day crisis management and monitors policy implementation.

A third, lower level of interagency committees generally determines what will rise up to the deputies. In previous administrations, the committees usually were chaired by a lead department or agency — normally the State or Defense departments. Obama’s directive moved them into the White House, chaired by the NSC.

Former officials who participated in Obama’s White House transition and later served in senior administration posts described that decision as a crucial driver toward more centralization. “It was a conscious decision to elevate the NSC’s role by having it chair those committees,” one said.

But it was far from the only reason for growth.

The staff grew by 35 almost immediately, when Obama folded the Homeland Security Council established by his predecessor into the NSC. Slightly more than half of today’s NSC personnel — many of them detailees from other agencies who are not on the White House payroll — are what Rice calls “policy people.” The rest are divided among management and human resources staff and about 100 who supply technology support, including manning the White House Situation Room in shifts, 24 hours a day.

Staffing of traditional NSC “directorates” and “coordinators,” organized by function and geographic regions, ballooned with each new crisis. Surging issues such as cyber- and health security — including Ebola — brought additional staff.

Each subject area produces White House-run meetings, often overlapping sessions called by separate NSC chieftains on security, economic and diplomatic aspects of the same issue. For every meeting, both NSC and agency personnel are tasked with writing issue and option papers than can run to a dozen or more pages.

Rice — who came to the job with unique prior experience at the NSC and the State Department and as a Cabinet member during Obama’s first term — resisted her initial impulse to cut staff until she understood the reasons for the growth. This year, as part of her review, she has folded the separate Bush-era NSC office in charge of Afghanistan-Pakistan affairs back into the South Asia directorate. Implementation of the recently completed Iran nuclear agreement has been based at the State Department, along with the coordinator of the U.S.-led coalition fighting against the Islamic State.

The office that opened at the NSC last year to coordinate the Ebola response among agencies has also been closed, as that crisis has ebbed.

But Rice strongly defended its establishment in the first place. With participation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the State, Defense and Health and Human Services departments; and the U.S. Agency for International Development, she said, the U.S. response “wasn’t working until we sucked it into the White House and the president put his personal muscle behind it.”

Nearly every Thursday morning since the September 2012 terrorist attacks on the U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya, senior and mid-level officials from at least five government agencies have gathered at the White House to talk about security for U.S. facilities and personnel overseas.

Protecting diplomats and other Americans abroad is a core responsibility of the State Department. Yet the weekly talks are convened by the NSC and led by Lisa Monaco, Obama’s chief counterterrorism adviser, who guides discussions about where threats are greatest and what kind of protection should be available.

To the White House, this makes perfect sense. Many agencies have personnel based overseas, and many of the resources to protect them reside outside the State Department.

“It used to be that State ran foreign policy,” said a former White House official. “Now, everyone’s got a hand in it. Go around the table, and they’ve all got equities, they’ve all got personnel out in the field, and all that needs to be managed.”

But others drew a direct line from White House management of the issue back to the political embarrassment of the Benghazi attacks, which resulted in the deaths of four U.S. officials. Nearly three years later, a Republican-led congressional committee is still searching for a smoking gun of administration cover-up.

“Benghazi is a good example,” the former official said, “and . . . Ebola. That can’t just be left to CDC and State and others to manage. No. You have to have a czar and a whole team of people. And why is that? Because the politics on this issue have become so much more corrosive and challenging that it’s a natural instinct for the White House to say, ‘We’ve got to have an eye on this. On everything.’ ”

The embassy security meetings have frequently bogged down over minor issues, such as whether to deploy a handful of Special Operations troops or to approve a State Department request for an additional 10 diplomats at an embassy. One official recalled that White House oversight even extended to the overseas deployment of dog handlers and their bomb-sniffing canines.

“The first thing I’m going to do is to stop all this micromanagement from the NSC,” Deputy Secretary Antony J. Blinken joked as he chaired his first senior staff meeting at the State Department in December, after moving there from his White House job as Rice’s deputy.

Blinken, who has gone back and forth among buildings several times, knows better than most that where one sits usually indicates where one stands on the subject.

“When you look at it” from the White House’s perspective, another former official whose career has traveled much the same path said of micromanagement charges, “and you’re just constantly worried about something going wrong, and you’re wearing the shirt for it, you can understand how this happens.”

In January, as internal administration complaints about the NSC escalated, Rice acknowledged the problems but praised the policy outcomes.

“If you look at where we started in 2014, we had no Ukraine and Russia, no Ebola, and no ISIL as the next major counterterrorism” threat, she said in an interview at the time, referring to the Islamic State. “In each of those instances of unforeseen crisis, on top of all the business we were having to do anyway, with some complexity and obviously not always with perfect form, we bent the curve.

“Style points? Sure. Take some off at the margins,” she said. “Substance? Managing an unprecedented array of complex crises and continuing at the same time to pursue the president’s long-term agenda on things that will matter when the music stops, like climate change and Cuba? I feel pretty good.”

But at the same time, she decided she had seen and heard enough to know that her initial reaction to the NSC’s size and structure might have merit. At her direction, aides drew up staffing charts and held focus groups to solicit suggestions for improvement. Senior officials were interviewed; organizational meetings were held.

By June, a statement posted on the White House blog promised a newly “lean, nimble, and policy-oriented” NSC, with “fewer, more focused meetings, less paper to produce and consume, and more communication that yields better policymaking.”

In late July, more than half a year after she began the exercise, Rice said that she was satisfied with the results. “We’re going to keep going” with staff trims, she said. “But we’re going to do it in a thoughtful way. . . . We need to not compromise quality simply for the sake of structure.”

Opinions on the depth of the changes differ. One senior department official agreed last month that there were fewer NSC meetings and less paperwork. Another official, en route to a third White House meeting on a single recent day, hadn’t noticed any change.",0
62333,Comment on Invention Secrecy At All-Time High: Thousands Of Patent Applications Placed Under Secrecy Orders by Physicists Say Consciousness Should Be Considered A State of Matter: The “Non Physical” Is Real – Collective Evolution,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Government secrecy is running rampant in an age where more and more people are demanding transparency. Did you know that the U.S. Government classifies over 500 million pages of documents each year? Justification for the mass classification of information is (apparently) done for the sake of “national security,” but as we know:   “The dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts, far outweigh the dangers that are cited to justify them. There is a very grave danger that an announced need for an increased level of security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of censorship and concealment. That I do not tend to permit, so long as it’s in my control.”– JFK ( source ) If a scholar wanted to research political, historical, scientific, or any other type of archival work, it would prove difficult and limiting seeing that most of their government’s activities are kept a secret. It is truly impossible to access the factual history of their country. The declassification of classified documents (a small portion) does not occur until decades after that information has been concealed, one great example of that is the UFO phenomenon, once believed to be a “conspiracy theory” by the masses before the substantial release of government documents showing otherwise. You can read more about that and access some of those documents here . Evidence is now pointing to the fact that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is no different. The office is supposed to legally protect the inventions of entrepreneurs and companies, some of whom have developed ground breaking technology. Unfortunately, that’s not the case as new documents obtained via the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) reveal how the Patent Office has been using a secret system to withhold the approval of some applications. This 50-page document was obtained by Kilpatrick Towsend & Stockton, LLP, who commonly represent major tech companies that include Apple, Google and Twitter (to name a few). You can view that entire document HERE . ( 1 ) The program delaying patent applications is called the Sensitive Application Warning System (SWAS). Usually, when an application is submitted for a patent approval it requires a couple of examiners who work with the Patent office to go through their process of approval. This process usually takes approximately 1 to 2 years, but applications that are filed in SAWS must be approved from several people, and can be delayed for a number of years.   “There is no official channel to notify an applicant once their patent is placed in the system, and the Patent Office has denied requests to divulge what applications are on the SAWS list.” ( source ) The documents also indicate areas of technology that might have a patent application placed in the SAWS program – these include smartphones, internet-enabling systems and more. This information is set to be published in an online journal called “Law360” to inform the public. Tech Columnist Alyssa Bereznak at Yahoo News states that most companies are fully aware of this. I first came across this recent information in her article, which you can view here , but I felt compelled to add more information. As you will see below, there is more information that has surfaced prior to these documents that suggest this type of “invention secrecy” goes far beyond these technologies. One great example (out of many) of delayed patent applications comes from Dr. Gerald F. Ross. He filed a patent application for a new invention he had devised to defeat the jamming of electromagnetic transmissions at specified frequencies. It was not until June 17, 2014 (almost 37 years later) that this patent was granted. ( 2 ) Invention Secrecy Is Still Going Strong 
As great as it is to see new information pertaining to invention secrecy come to light, it’s also important to note (as reported by the Federation of American Scientists; see annotated bibliography) that there were over 5000 inventions that were under secrecy orders at the end of Fiscal Year 2014, which marked the highest number of secrecy orders in effect since 1994.( 3 ) This is all thanks to an act many people are unaware of. It’s called the “Invention Secrecy Act” and it was written up in 1951. Under this act, patent applications on new inventions can be subject to secrecy orders. These orders can restrict their publication if government agencies believe that their disclosure would be harmful to national security.( 4 )( 5 ) As mentioned earlier, “national security” has become an excuse and justification for the classification of a large amount of information on a variety of topics that the public is deliberately kept in the dark about. Apparently, many of these projects and inventions go far above and beyond presidential knowledge. “It is ironic that the U.S. should be fighting monstrously expensive wars allegedly to bring democracy to those countries, when it itself can no longer claim to be called a democracy when trillions, and I mean thousands of billions of dollars, have been spent on projects which both congress and the commander in chief know nothing about.” ( source ) – Paul Hellyer, Former Canadian Defense Minister. So what type of technology is under restriction under the Invention Secrecy Act? We don’t really know, but a previous list from 1971 was obtained by researcher Michael Ravnitzky. Most of the technology listed seems to be related to various military applications. You can view that list HERE . ( 6 ) As Steven Aftergood from the Federation of American Scientists reports: “The 1971 list indicates that patents for solar photovoltaic generators were subject to review and possible restriction if the photovoltaics were more than 20% efficient. Energy conversion systems were likewise subject to review and possible restriction if they offered conversion efficiencies in “excess of 70-80%.” ( source ) Secrecy is No Secret A couple of years before the Invention Secrecy Act of 1951, the National Security Act was created. As a result, a number of intelligence groups and executive bodies followed. None of these groups had any active congressional oversight. The United States has a history of government agencies existing in secret for years. The National Security Agency (NSA) was founded in 1952, its existence was hidden until the mid 1960’s. Even more secretive is the National Reconnaissance Office, which was founded in 1960 but remained completely secret for 30 years. Along with this secrecy is the information these agencies obtained, and continue to obtain until this day. Special Access Programs are another great example of secrecy. From these we have unacknowledged and waived SAPs. These programs do not exist publicly, but they do indeed exist. They are better known as ‘deep black programs.’ A 1997 US Senate report described them as “so sensitive that they are exempt from standard reporting requirements to the Congress.” ( 7 )(8) We don’t really hear about black budget programs, or about people who have actually looked into them. However, the topic was discussed in 2010 by Washington Post journalists Dana Priest and William Arkin. Their investigation lasted approximately two years and concluded that America’s classified world has: “Become so large, so unwieldy and so secretive that no one knows how much money it costs, how many people it employs, how many programs exist within it or exactly how many agencies do the same work.” (9) You can read more about the Black Budget in detail HERE . Today, it seems to be evidently clear that secrecy has lead to what Dwight Eisenhower warned us about: “In the council of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex. The potential disaster of the rise of misplaced power exists, and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes.” ( source ) What Has All This Secrecy Led To? 
The fact that so much information is concealed from the public domain has led to a kind of “breakaway civilization.” A term coined by Richard Dolan . 
Someone, or some groups are “in the know.” This or these groups who have had access to information over many decades that the public hasn’t is no doubt living and perceiving the world in a different way from what the masses do. This has led to a world within worlds, a separate civilization apart of our own who have access to knowledge that we don’t. Who are they? What are they doing? Why are they doing it? What do they know?

President Trump’s latest meeting with a foreign leader, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, went smoothly. They pledged cooperation on trade, investment and border security. And, joined by Ivanka Trump, they met with female executives and announced an initiative to assist women in business. In private talks, Mr. Trudeau was expected to welcome the prospect of renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement, a move that could test his commitment to internationalist principles. _____ 2. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan was greeted with higher approval ratings when he returned home from his weekend golf outing with Mr. Trump in Florida. But there was surprise in the United States as it became clear that the two leaders discussed their response to North Korea’s missile test in full view of diners at Mr. Trump’s    resort, with aides pointing the lights from their smartphones at briefing documents. North Korea claims its launch shows progress toward   capabilities. The National Security Council, normally the president’s main arm to develop foreign policy, is in turmoil from top to bottom. Michael Flynn was said to have resigned as national security adviser following reports that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence over his contacts with Russia. _____ 3. On the homefront, Mr. Trump’s nominee for Treasury Secretary, the financier Steven Mnuchin, was confirmed by the Senate. And Republicans are hitting a roadblock in their quest to “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act: Constituents upset that there is no plan to replace it have made themselves heard at public meetings in California, Utah and Wisconsin. “I’d be lying to you if I told you it was fun,” said Representative Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, who faced a frustrated crowd on Saturday. _____ 4. Inside Trump Tower, the president’s sons talked to The Times about pressing on with global deals  —   and rebutting waves of criticism over ethical concerns. “His DNA will always be in the company in a big way,” Eric Trump said during nearly five hours of interviews over two days last week. “His DNA built the company. His DNA also built us. We’re extensions of him in so many ways. ” _____ 5. More harrowing details about the suffering of civilians in the Syrian city of Aleppo: Canisters of chlorine gas, a banned weapon, were dumped on residential areas at least eight times in the final weeks of the battle to retake the city from rebels, Human Rights Watch reported.

Burton was sentenced to five days in jail, but she has been released on a stay while an appeal is underway.Burton will stay out of jail during the appeals process as long as she obeys Milich s order not to wear items that make a political statement in court. If she loses her appeal, she will have to serve the five days in jail.Milich said his opinions have nothing to do with his decision. A judge doesn t support either side,  he said.  A judge is objective and tries to make sure everyone has an opportunity to have a fair hearing, and it was a situation where it was just in violation of the law,  he said.WATCH:The Youngstown branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) said its legal counsel is monitoring the case closely as it may violate Burton s civil rights.The judge said his ruling is based on Supreme Court case law in which a judge can prohibit symbolic political expression in courtrooms, even if it s not disruptive.

63368,Brazil's president loses minister as PSDB party quits coalition,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Michel Temer accepted the resignation on Friday of his minister of political affairs, whose party is abandoning the ruling coalition to ready for the 2018 election. Antonio Imbassahy of the Brazilian Social Democratic Party (PSDB) has handled the government s relations with Congress, keeping an unwieldy coalition united in blocking the prosecution of Temer on corruption charges earlier this year. However the PSDB, Temer s largest ally, has split over whether to stick with the unpopular president in the run-up to a general election next October, when the party plans to field its own presidential candidate. The PSDB will hold its national convention in Brasilia on Saturday, when it is expected to elect Sao Paulo Governor Geraldo Alckmin as its new party leader, replacing Senator Aecio Neves, who is under investigation for graft. That would make Alckmin the PSDB s most likely candidate in next year s presidential race. Allies say Alckmin plans to continue his party s disengagement from the Temer government, where the PSDB still has two ministers, including Foreign Minister Aloysio Nunes, who is expected to stay on the job based on personal conviction. Still, Alckmin is expected to mobilize PSDB support for Temer s signature legislation proposal, the overhaul of Brazil s costly social security system. Investors consider the measure crucial to closing a huge budget deficit that cost Latin America s largest economy its investment-grade credit rating. Temer needs the PSDB s 46 votes in the lower house of Congress to win passage of the pension reform bill, which is set for a vote the week of Dec. 18. ",0
23662,Comment on 4 of the Best Kinds of Milk That Aren’t Dairy by 4 of the Best Kinds of Milk That Aren’t Dairy – Collective Evolution | APG Editorial,"  Now, numerous studies have concluded that milk doesn’t actually build bone and provide the same amount of calcium that we thought. A study published in the British Medical Journal , for example, followed more than 100,000 people in Sweden over periods of 20 to 30 years, with shocking results: The people who drank milk were more likely to die from heart disease and cancer. The women suffered more overall fractures and hip fractures as well. Different studies have also shown that higher dairy intake is linked to higher risks of prostate and ovarian cancer and can trigger type 1 diabetes. It is also linked to forms of acne, just to name a few effects. There is also the disturbing side of the dairy industry, where animals are abused to produce the milk we drink. A lot of dairy products are filled with the hormones that were given to female cows to keep them perpetually lactating so they produce an endless flow of milk. This doctor describes it perfectly when he says “cow’s milk is for baby calfs, just like human milk is for babies.” It is a substance we need while in crucial stages of development, but past a certain age, it becomes obsolete. While there are many alternatives to dairy milk, some are much better than others. Here are some of the better “milk” products out there. Almond Milk Raw organic almond milk is a great choice when you know where it’s coming from. As with many mass produced products, even some almond milks aren’t the best for us. An analysis of a UK almond milk brand showed that nuts make up only 2% of the drink itself. A single serving of almond milk has almost no protein. Compared with plain old almonds, it fares even worse. There is one place where almond milk comes out on top, of course: It has more potassium and more of the vitamins A and D. But almond milk is fortified with these nutrients — they’ve been added during the production process. Making almond milk yourself, however, is a fantastic option, and allows you to control exactly what goes inside it, ensuring there are no additives, preservatives, or substances you’ve never even heard of before. Rice Milk Rice milk is another good choice that works well as a dairy substitute, if you don’t mind the taste. It’s higher in carbohydrates than other milk choices and contains around the same amount of calcium as cow’s milk. Yet it contains almost no protein, so it needs to be balanced with other protein rich foods. During processing, the carbs break down into sugars and give the milk a sweet taste. It is filled with more sugar, around 10 grams for one serving, which is a lot more than something like coconut milk, which has around 3 grams. If you’re trying to have as little sugar as possible, rice milk may not be the best choice, but it’s certainly better than plain old dairy milk. Coconut Milk Coconut milk is definitely one of the healthier options here. When this milk is all natural, meaning there’s no added sugars, natural flavours, or preservatives, it is incredibly healthy for us. “ Coconuts are highly nutritious and rich in fibre, vitamins C, E, B1, B3, B5 and B6 and minerals including iron, selenium, sodium, calcium, magnesium and phosphorous.” The things that makes coconuts so good is the type of fat they contain. They have a form of medium-chain fatty acids rather than long-chain fatty acids, which are stored in our tissue for much longer. One of the beneficial acids within coconuts is called lauric acid. This gets converted inside the body into a beneficial substance called monolaurin acid, which acts as an antiviral agent. But unlike other milks, if you have access, you can go right up to a coconut tree and drink the milk straight from the coconut without the need for processing. This is one of the most pure and fresh ways to get some milk in you! Hemp Milk Ah, hemp; one of the most versatile plants on our planet. Hemp milk has a wide range of health benefits that a lot of other milks don’t. Some companies make fully organic, non-GMO, and unsweetened hemp milk, but it’s always good to check exactly where you’re getting your products from. Hemp milk has a more bean-like and nutty flavor to it, which still tastes great in many drinks or foods. It’s also packed with healthy omega-3 fatty acids, which help with our heart health. In a single 8-ounce glass of hemp milk you can find the following nutrients: Vitamin A",1
47919,Ryan says Republican tax plan must speed through choppy waters: Reuters interview,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Wednesday that a sweeping Republican tax-cut plan is entering its toughest phase yet as lobbyists swarm Congress to try to protect valuable tax breaks. Urging lawmakers to move quickly on the plan, Ryan said in an interview with Reuters that speedy action would prevent the legislation getting bogged down and deliver sooner the economic growth that Republicans expect from it. “K Street,” as Washington’s lobbying industry is known after the downtown street where much of it is based, will soon descend on Capitol Hill to defend tax benefits for companies and other special interests, said Ryan, the top Republican in Congress.     “When the details come, that is when you’re going to see K Street coming to Congress. And that’s why this hasn’t been done for 31 years,” said Ryan, looking back to the country’s last major tax code overhaul under President Ronald Reagan in 1986. While the broad parameters of the Republican plan, backed by President Donald Trump, have been made public, detailed legislation is not expected to be revealed until next week.  Securing passage by Congress of the tax plan would give Trump his first major legislative win since he took office in January. Republicans control the White House and both chambers of Congress and are under pressure to deliver on their election campaign promises. Final action on taxes is at least weeks away. The Republican plan would cut taxes for businesses and people by up to $6 trillion over the next decade, according to independent analysts.  It calls for reducing the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and setting a lower rate for smaller businesses, as well as cutting taxes for individuals and allowing larger deductions for families. Democrats have called it a gift to the rich and to corporate America that would cause the federal deficit to balloon and add to the $20 trillion U.S. national debt.     Ryan referred to white-water rafting to describe how the tax overhaul effort is entering its toughest phase. “We’ve been going through Class 3 rapids, which is a pleasant ride. It’s nice. Everybody pretty much stays in the boat and it’s pretty good. But we’re about to go through Class 5 rapids, which is the biggest rapid you can go through,” he said.  He called on Republicans to hold tight as details are hammered out. “We’ve got to make sure that everybody stays in the boat and we get the boat down the river,” Ryan said.     He dismissed concerns that tax cuts could expand the federal deficit. “We don’t anticipate a big deficit effect from this tax reform because we will broaden the base and lower the rates, plug loopholes and get faster economic growth.”      Republicans intend to pay for their proposed cuts in part by broadening the tax base. That would require discarding trillions of dollars of tax deductions, loopholes and other breaks, each one protected by powerful interests. If lobbyists succeed in protecting such tax breaks, lawmakers would be looking at less revenue to offset the tax cuts, raising the risk of higher deficits and debt that could undermine long-term economic growth.     Ryan has previously said he wants the House to pass the tax bill by the Nov. 23 U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. He predicted on Wednesday that some Democratic lawmakers would back the tax plan. “At the end of the day, I do believe some Democrats will end up voting for this thing,” Ryan said. “It’s hard for me to see why - no matter what party you’re from - you’d want to vote against this.”  At least some Democratic support could end up being needed in the Senate, where Republicans hold only a 52-48 majority. Party dissent in the Senate led to Republicans’ failure this summer to push through an overhaul of the healthcare system that Trump and the party leadership had pushed for.  Ryan, from Wisconsin, blamed Democrats for the lack of bipartisanship in Washington. Republicans are drafting the tax legislation on their own. “I so wish we had Bill Bradley Democrats around these days. We do not have Bill Bradley Democrats. Believe me, I really, really wish we did,” Ryan said, referring to Democratic former Senator Bill Bradley, who played a key bipartisan role in the Reagan tax reform. Among Republicans, skirmishes around the tax breaks have already begun. Some Republican lawmakers are resisting a proposal to eliminate a popular deduction for state and local tax payments, which would hit middle-class voters in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California.  “You do have to broaden the base in order to lower the rates. And that is what reform is,” Ryan said. “With respect to state and local, I think there’s a way of addressing the concerns that our members have for middle income taxpayers … so that they are net winners in tax reform as well.”       Ryan also said Republican lawmakers will not take up a bipartisan plan to stabilize Obamacare insurance markets or try again this year to repeal and replace former President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. The House speaker said he wants Congress to pass legislation to protect illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children but offered no timetable. Asked about strong denunciations of Trump this week by two Republican senators, Ryan said people should “settle their differences personally” rather than in public. He also urged the Department of Justice to immediately give Congress documents related to the funding of a dossier on Trump during the presidential campaign.     ",0
66450,Democratic lawmakers press Flynn on Middle East trips,"(Reuters) - Democratic lawmakers investigating fired national security adviser Michael Flynn’s security clearance said Monday they could not find the hotel Flynn said he stayed at during a 2015 trip to Saudi Arabia or any record of a conference he reported attending. In a letter to companies for which Flynn worked, U.S. Representatives Elijah Cummings and Eliot Engel requested documents related to Flynn’s work in Saudi Arabia, Russia and other countries. They said Flynn had not accurately reported his foreign travels and contacts in a 2016 application to renew his security clearance. Cummings is the ranking Democrat on the House of Representatives’ Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Engel is the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Flynn’s work for foreign interests has taken center stage in a broad federal investigation into the ties between President Donald Trump’s associates and Russia and other countries during and after the 2016 election. While Flynn disclosed an October 2015 trip to Saudi Arabia, Cummings and Engel said Flynn omitted key details and said they could not identify any conference he may have attended or find the hotel he reported staying at during the trip. The two lawmakers said they were most troubled by the lack of any Flynn record identifying “even a single foreign government official he had contact with in the seven years prior to submitting his security clearance application.” Cummings and Engel also cited a recent Newsweek report which said Flynn took a trip to the Middle East in the summer of 2015 in pursuit of a joint U.S.-Russian venture to develop nuclear facilities, in a deal to be financed by Saudi Arabia. “If this press report is accurate, General Flynn’s failure to report this trip and any contacts with foreign government officials about this Saudi-Russian nuclear proposal appears to be a potential violation” of a law against making false statements to federal officials, the letter said.

46148,Tree trimming firm pays biggest fine in U.S. immigration case,"(Reuters) - A tree trimming company has been handed the largest penalty imposed in a United States immigration case, totaling $95 million, after pleading guilty to employing illegal immigrants, the U.S. Attorney’s Office said. Immigration reform is a major political issue in the U.S., with  President Donald Trump saying he will crack down on illegal immigrants and build a wall between the United States and Mexico in order to reduce illegal border crossings.  Asplundh Tree Experts, Co., which trims trees and clears brush for power and gas lines across the country, hired employees who provided fake identification documents from 2010 to 2014, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Philadelphia said.  The prosecutor said on Thursday that Asplundh’s management were “willfully blind”, while supervisors and general foremen hired illegal immigrants through word of mouth referrals.  “This decentralized model tacitly perpetuated fraudulent hiring practices that, in turn, maximized productivity and profit,” it said.  The company’s chairman and CEO Scott Asplundh said in a statement that it has taken steps to improve its hiring practices, including reviewing the identification of all employees.  “We accept responsibility for the charges as outlined, and we apologize to our customers, associates and all other stakeholders for what has occurred,” he said.

65888,America Needs To Wake Up – There is ZERO Hope For Our Country Until We Turn From Our Evil Ways,"in: Faith , Society , US News America is never going to be great again until we deal with the wickedness in our own hearts. In recent days I have listened to so many national leaders tell us that Donald Trump is going to win the election and that this will usher in a new golden age of blessing and prosperity for America. Supposedly this is going to happen even though we continue to slaughter babies on an industrial scale, sexually-transmitted diseases are spreading at the fastest pace in decades, the percentage of births out of wedlock is more than 10 times higher than in 1940, and approximately two out of every three Christian men watch pornography on a regular basis. Even though there aren’t any signs of widespread national repentance, we are supposedly going to be showered with wealth, favor, protection and good times for as far as the eye can see. You can believe this if you want, but it doesn’t have any basis in reality. The truth is that we live in a nation where just about every type of evil that you can possibly imagine is spreading like wildfire. Just look at the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. According to the CDC, there are 20 million new cases of sexually-transmitted disease in the United States every year. And last year, cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis grew at a very alarming pace … Cases of sexually transmitted diseases in the United States have reached new highs, including an increase in syphilis not seen since the mid-1990s, federal health officials said in a report this week. There were 1.5 million chlamydia cases in 2015 — the last year that numbers were available — a 6 percent increase from the year before, and about 400,000 infections of gonorrhea, or a 13 percent rise , according to a report by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . But syphilis cases increased to levels unseen since the mid-1990s. There were nearly 24,000 cases of primary and secondary syphilis cases last year, a 19 percent hike compared with 2014. We are a nation that has fully embraced the “free love” philosophy of the 1960s. We have sex with whoever we want, whenever we want, and we don’t seem to care about the consequences. As a result, the nuclear family is rapidly being destroyed. Back in 1940, 3.8 percent of all babies were born to women that were not married. Today, that number is over 40 percent . 2008 (the year Barack Obama was elected) was the very first year in our history when 40 percent of all babies were born to unmarried mothers, and we have now stayed at that level for eight straight years . If we want to make America great again, we can start by not sleeping with people that we are not married to. But of course an increasing number of Americans (especially our young people) are discarding traditional notions of love, marriage and sexuality completely. At one time we were told that the choice was between “gay” and “straight”, but now many people have decided that they want absolutely no limits. Miley Cyrus is among those that are now identifying themselves as “pansexuals”. The following comes from a recent article by Jennifer LeClaire … “My mom is like an ’80s rock chick—big blonde hair. … She loves being a girl,” Cyrus said. “I never felt that way. I know some girls that love getting their nails done. I … hated it … I don’t wax my eyebrows. I never related to loving being a girl. And then, being a boy didn’t sound fun to me. I think the LGBTQ alphabet could continue forever. But there’s a ‘P’ that should happen, for ‘pansexual.’” According to Google , a “pansexual” is “not limited in sexual choice with regard to biological sex, gender, or gender identity.” Millions of young girls look up to Miley Cyrus as a role model. We knew that this sort of thing was coming in the last days, but it is still hard to grasp how far America has fallen. And if you try to speak out against this wave of evil, you might just lose everything. For instance, the bakery in Oregon that didn’t want to make a wedding cake for a lesbian couple has been forced to close their doors permanently … The Oregon bakery that made news after it refused to make a cake for a lesbian couple’s wedding has closed after legal battles left the business financial devastated, according to a Christian news site. Aaron and Melissa Klein, owners of Sweet Cakes By Melissa, have shut down their bakery, according to the store’s Facebook page. ‘We have closed Sweet Cakes. We appreciate everyone’s continued prayer and support,’ the post said. We live in a nation where the culture has been fundamentally transformed. According to a newly released Pew Research Center survey , an all-time high 57 percent of all Americans believe that marijuana should be legalized and only 37 percent are against it. With that kind of a margin, it is only a matter of time before marijuana is legalized all over the country. We also live in a nation that is absolutely addicted to watching other people have sex. And most Christian men cannot even speak out about this epidemic because they are doing it themselves. According to Charisma News , one survey found that an astounding 68 percent of all Christian men admit that they watch pornography on a regular basis. But even if we turned away from all of the other behaviors that I have just mentioned, there would still be no hope for our nation as long as we continue to murder babies on an industrial scale. Did you see the final debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton? During that debate, Clinton made it exceedingly clear that she is in favor of abortion throughout all nine months of pregnancy. The Democratic platform openly calls for taxpayer funding of abortion and a complete repeal of the Hyde Amendment, and Bill and Hillary Clinton have made abortion one of the central pillars of their very long political careers. Their hands are absolutely drenched with the blood of dead children, and the American people are about to reward her by making her the next president of the United States . So no, I don’t buy it when people try to tell me that America is on the verge of a new era of greatness. The truth is that we are a cesspool of wickedness and filth, and unless we repent we are going to reap a very bitter harvest from what we have sown for so many years. Submit your review",1
33041,"For Democrats, Anthony Weiner Makes an Unwelcome Return - The New York Times","Carolyn B. Maloney, a congresswoman from the Upper East Side, was riding in a taxi on Friday when she heard the news: Emails discovered in an investigation into Anthony D. Weiner’s sexting had revived the F. B. I. ’s interest in the case of Hillary Clinton’s private server. “I said: ‘Oh, no, not this, not happening now,’” she said. And then Ms. Maloney’s thoughts turned to Mr. Weiner. “I can’t stand him  —   even before this,” Ms. Maloney said. On the West Coast, John L. Burton, the chairman of the California Democratic Party, informed of Mr. Weiner’s inadvertent intrusion into the election on Friday evening, let loose an emphatic expletive. “We’re still talking about that guy during a presidential election?” Mr. Burton fumed, using a profane   word instead of “guy. ” Weiner  —   the name became almost a curse word among senior Democrats over the past two days, as the disgraced congressman unexpectedly surfaced in the final stretch of the presidential contest. The news resurrected memories of previous Weiner scandals. “He is like a recurring nightmare,” said the Rev. Al Sharpton. “It’s like one of those ‘Damien’ movies  —   it’s like every time you think he’s dead, he keeps coming again. ” The fury that many leading Democrats feel toward Mr. Weiner had been building for years. His sexting habits embarrassed them. His attempted political comeback in 2013 disgusted them. But their high regard for his   wife, Huma Abedin, always kept them from going public. On Friday that was over. Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers and an influential Clinton supporter, said she had long held her tongue out of “enormous respect and love” for Ms. Abedin. But Ms. Weingarten said Mr. Weiner’s treatment of women demanded forceful censure. “I don’t care who it is, no one should be a sexual predator,” Ms. Weingarten said. “I think we all have to take a stand about that, and I think what’s happening now is that people are. ” Mr. Weiner, who lost his seat in Congress and his mayoral hopes after repeated episodes in which he sent lewd messages to women, is now under federal investigation for allegedly sending sexual messages to a    girl in North Carolina. In that inquiry, the F. B. I. this month seized a laptop that contained thousands of messages belonging to Ms. Abedin, a top aide to Mrs. Clinton. The F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, told Congress on Friday that investigators will now review those messages for possible relevance to the Clinton inquiry, news that rattled the Clinton campaign and stung her supporters. For some, the development touched off more worry than anger: former President Bill Clinton, who learned of the news en route to his last event of the day, in Pennsylvania, fretted that it would draw hostile attention to Ms. Abedin, according to a person familiar with his thinking. Around the country, former aides to Mr. Weiner, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, traded emails and texts throughout the weekend, fuming at the “collateral damage” inflicted by their onetime boss. Mr. Weiner did not respond to an email seeking comment. Mrs. Clinton’s campaign has largely ignored Mr. Weiner’s connection so far, and has instructed campaign surrogates to avoid discussing his role. But amid fears that Mr. Weiner’s behavior might undermine the party in a critical election, Democrats  —   especially in his native New York  —   said that perhaps they had given Mr. Weiner too many second chances over the years, and given him too much latitude out of deference to Ms. Abedin. Beyond New York, there was a sense of disbelief that one former lawmaker, whose memorable surname and lewd online habits made him a staple of   comedy, could disrupt the election of an American president. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in an interview with CNN, blurted out, “Oh, God,” at the mention of Mr. Weiner’s name. He added, “I’m not a big fan. ” But Mr. Weiner has been a figure of consternation in Democratic politics for years, in New York and nationally, regarded simultaneously as a sharp political mind and a man of striking immaturity and   ambition. With a gift for combat on cable television, Mr. Weiner repeatedly forced himself to the fore of Democratic politics, despite being seen by many in the party as too clever by half, too boastful about his intelligence  —   and too hungry for attention from reporters and women. A 2001 story in Vanity Fair captured Mr. Weiner, then unmarried, leering at congressional interns while presenting himself as an   salesman. When Mr. Weiner explored a campaign for mayor in 2009, aides to Michael R. Bloomberg, who was seeking a third term, highlighted media coverage of his support for legislation making it easier for foreign models to get approval for visas. “We had a sense of who he was,” said Bradley Tusk, who was campaign manager for Mr. Bloomberg. “He knew exactly who he was. ” Also before the same election, Senator Chuck Schumer, for whom Mr. Weiner once worked, privately expressed frustration that Mr. Weiner was insufficiently interested in substance, telling one aide: “It’s all political ricochet. ” The senator is said to have made his peace with Mr. Weiner’s problems long ago. But Mr. Schumer is in line to lead Senate Democrats next year, and any damage from Mr. Weiner’s latest scandal could impede the party’s quest for a majority. Still, he won the lasting appreciation of Mrs. Clinton during the 2008 election, defending her in   fashion during a difficult primary against Barack Obama. And Mr. Weiner’s marriage to Ms. Abedin, in 2010, seemed to install him permanently among party elites  —   whatever their reservations about his company. So tied into the party’s power brokers was he, by marriage, that when Mr. Weiner sought to resurrect his political career with a bid for mayor in 2013, numerous Democratic donors cut checks to his campaign at Ms. Abedin’s urging. John P. Coale, a wealthy lawyer supportive of Mrs. Clinton, said many donors gave money to Mr. Weiner out of friendship with Ms. Abedin. But Mr. Coale said the 2013 race, which brought new revelations of more sexting, had been exasperating. “It was just too much for everybody,” Mr. Coale said. “And now, it’s out of the park. Come on. ” Bill Hyers, a Democratic strategist who managed Mayor Bill de Blasio’s campaign that year, said the party establishment had erred by allowing Mr. Weiner “a second breath of life. ” “They knew he was a narcissist who was massively flawed,” Mr. Hyers said. “And now we’re all still stuck with him. ” Among Democrats who shunned Mr. Weiner from the start, there was little joy at the apparent vindication of their judgment. Sarah Kovner, a major Democratic donor, said there was less concern that   injuries might cost Mrs. Clinton the election, than sheer frustration that a known bad seed had created such endless tumult. “We basically never wanted to have anything to do with him,” Ms. Kovner said of herself and her husband, Victor Kovner. “  too wise for himself, too glib, too full of himself  —   that’s how we felt about him. ” While predicting Mr. Weiner’s latest scandal would not doom Mrs. Clinton’s presidential hopes, Ms. Kovner sighed: “It is more pain. ”",0
40869,"Iran's Rouhani urges France to remain ""realistic, impartial"" in Middle East","BEIRUT/PARIS (Reuters) - France can play a productive role in the Middle East by taking a  realistic and impartial approach , Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, in a phone call on Tuesday, according to Iranian state media. Tensions between Iran and France increased last week after Macron said that Tehran should be less aggressive in the region and should clarify its ballistic missile program. His foreign minister also denounced Tehran s  hegemonic temptations  during a visit to Saudi Arabia.  Iranian state media said Rouhani told Macron that the Islamic Republic was ready to develop its relations with France on all bilateral, regional and international issues based on mutual respect and shared goals.  Rouhani referred to the  adventurism of some inexperienced princes in the region - an allusion to Iran s arch geopolitical rival, Saudi Arabia - and said France could play a positive role in easing the situation.  We are against adventurism and creating division in the region and believe that France, by keeping an independent vote and its position in the region, can, with a realistic and impartial approach, have a productive role,  he said. In a rare statement on both calls, Macron s office said he had talked to Rouhani and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu separately, telling them both that it was vital to keep Lebanon disassociated from regional crises.  He also said France was attached to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal with world powers, but that regional and ballistic issues should be discussed separately and constructively. Macron  also stressed the importance for the countries of the region to work collectively to reduce tensions,  the statement said. The foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia and other Arab states criticised Iran and its Lebanese Shi ite Muslim ally Hezbollah at talks in Cairo on Sunday, calling for a united front to counter Iranian influence. Rouhani also highlighted the importance of maintaining stability in Lebanon and, in the phone call with Macron, noted what he characterized as the threat posed by Israel.  Hezbollah are a part of the Lebanese people and are incredibly loved in this country. Their weapons are only defensive and are only for use in the face of a potential attack,  Rouhani said.  Now we have to try so the Lebanese groups can, with security, have a government that can help advance their country.  Macron, whose country has called for Hezbollah to disarm, has tried to mediate in a regional crisis that erupted after Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri announced his resignation in a broadcast from Saudi Arabia on Nov. 4, accusing Tehran and Hezbollah - which was part of his coalition government - of sowing strife across the Middle East. Macron spoke on Monday with Netanyahu, who is due in Paris in December, according to diplomatic sources. According to the Iranian state media, Macron invited Rouhani to Paris for a climate summit on Dec. 12. Macron s office did not respond when asked to confirm the invite. ",0
57331,International reaction to arrest of Reuters reporters in Myanmar,"(Reuters) - Several countries, the United Nations and journalist groups are demanding the release of Reuters reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo from detention in Myanmar.  The reporters were arrested on Dec. 12 after being invited to meet police officials on the outskirts of Yangon. They had worked on stories about a military crackdown in Rakhine state, scene of around 650,000 Rohingya Muslims fleeing to Bangladesh since August. Myanmar s Ministry of Information has said the reporters  illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media,  and released a photo of them in handcuffs. It said the reporters and two policemen faced charges under the British colonial-era Official Secrets Act, which carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years, though officials said they have not been charged. Their exact whereabouts are not known.  We and their families continue to be denied access to them or to the most basic information about their well-being and whereabouts,  Reuters President and Editor-In-Chief Stephen J. Adler said in a statement calling for their immediate release.      Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo are journalists who perform a crucial role in shedding light on news of global interest, and they are innocent of any wrongdoing,  he said. Here are comments on their detention from governments, politicians, human rights groups and press freedom advocates around the world:   Two U.N. human rights experts called on Thursday for Myanmar to release the two reporters, saying it was putting Myanmar on a dangerous path by using the Official Secrets Act to criminalize journalism.  Journalism is not a crime. These detentions are another way for the Government to censor information about the military s role in Rakhine State and the humanitarian catastrophe taking place,  said Yanghee Lee and David Kaye, who are the U.N. special rapporteur on Myanmar and on freedom of expression respectively. - A spokeswoman for Norway s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Wednesday:  Norway expects the Myanmar authorities to ensure the full protection of their rights and to release the journalists as quickly as possible.   - Human Rights Watch said the detentions appeared to be  aimed at stopping independent reporting of the ethnic cleansing campaign against the Rohingya.  Brad Adams, the group s Asia director, said,  Their secret, incommunicado detention lays bare government efforts to silence media reporting on critical issues.   - In Washington, the leading Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee called for their immediate release.  This is outrageous,  said Senator Ben Cardin.  It just brings back the memory of the horrible practices with the repressive military rule.  - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said last week the United States was  demanding their immediate release or information as to the circumstances around their disappearance.  On Tuesday, the State Department reiterated the U.S. demand for the reporters  immediate release. - Republican Thom Tillis and Democrat Chris Coons, leaders of the U.S. Senate Human Rights Caucus, said they were  gravely concerned  about the reporters  arrests and that press freedom was critical to ensuring accountability for violence against the Rohingya. Democratic congressman Ted Lieu, a member of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, called the arrests  outrageous and a direct attack on press freedom.  - Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kano said in response to a question from a Reuters reporter on Tuesday,  Freedom of the press is extremely important, including in order to protect fundamental human rights. The Japanese government would like to watch (this matter) closely.  Tokyo-based Human Rights Now  called on Japan on Wednesday to take a stronger stance.  - The European Union urged Myanmar on Monday to release the reporters  as quickly as possible.  A spokeswoman for EU  foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini said,  Freedom of the press and media is the foundation and a cornerstone of any democracy.  - U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said countries should do everything possible to secure the journalists  release and press freedom in Myanmar.  It is clearly a concern in relation to the erosion of press freedom in the country,  he said.  - Britain, Holland, Canada and Sweden have demanded the release of the Reuters reporters. Australia has expressed concern and Bangladesh has denounced the arrests.  - Vijay Nambiar, former special adviser on Myanmar to the U.N. Secretary-General, said in a statement to Reuters on Monday that the detentions had caused  widespread disappointment within and outside the country that is likely to further damage the international reputation and image of Myanmar, already under stress as a result of its handling of the Rakhine crisis.  - President of the European Parliament Antonio Tajani called on Myanmar to protect media freedoms and release the reporters. - The International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) called on Myanmar to immediately disclose the reporters  whereabouts.  All detainees must be allowed prompt access to a lawyer and to family members,  Frederick Rawski, ICJ s Asia-Pacific Regional Director, said on Monday. - The Committee to Protect Journalists said the arrests were  having a grave impact on the ability of journalists to cover a story of vital global importance . - Reporters Without Borders said there was no justification for the arrests and the charges being considered against the journalists were  completely spurious . - Advocacy group Fortify Rights demanded Myanmar  immediately and unconditionally release the Reuters journalists.  - Myanmar s Irrawaddy online news site called on Dec. 14 for the journalists  release in an editorial headlined  The Crackdown on the Media Must Stop.  It said  it is an outrage to see the Ministry of Information release a police record photo of reporters handcuffed   as police normally do to criminals   on its website soon after the detention. It is chilling to see that MOI has suddenly brought us back to the olden days of a repressive regime.  - The Southeast Asian Press Alliance said the journalists were  only doing their jobs in trying to fill the void of information on the Rohingya conflict.   - The Protection Committee for Myanmar Journalists, local reporters who have demonstrated against prosecutions of journalists, decried the  unfair arrests that affect media freedom .  - The Foreign Correspondents  Club of Myanmar said it was  appalled  by the arrests and  gravely concerned  about press freedom in Myanmar.  - The Foreign Correspondents  Club in Thailand, Foreign Correspondents  Association of the Philippines, Jakarta Foreign Correspondents  Club and Foreign Correspondents  Club of Hong Kong have issued statements supporting the journalists.

49518, What Obama Said At His First Mosque Visit Will Drive The Right Insane (VIDEO),"President Obama paid the first visit to a U.S.-based mosque and made a stirring call to unity between Islam and America s other major religions. In his visit to the Islamic Society of Baltimore in Maryland, Obama cut through a lot of conservative Republican rhetoric about the role of Islam in America. Muslim Americans keep up safe,  Obama told the audience, crediting the contributions Muslims have made to communities.  They are our police. They are our fire fighters. They re in (the Department of) Homeland Security. President Obama has had to repeatedly, patiently explain during the course of his presidency that the United States is not at war with Islam, but in fact relies on practitioners of the faith to serve side by side in the war against international terrorism.By contrast, Republican conservatives have constantly demonized Islam, acting as if its followers are monolithically pro-terrorism, when in reality the violent acts have been carried out by an extremely small sect. Top tier Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has gone the furthest, calling for a Muslim registry and a ban on Muslim travel to the country.In the speech today, President Obama explained: We are one American family. We will rise and fall together. He specifically spoke out to young Muslim Americans, who may feel lost and shunned thanks to extremist right-wing rhetoric about their faith: You re right where you belong. You re part of America too. In the speech, Obama also called on the media to do more to include Muslims in films and television shows, pointing out that Muslims shouldn t just be cast in roles about terrorism, but rather in roles that reflect their diverse standing in American life. The President pointed out that this has been done before, as there once were not many portrayals of black Americans in film/tv.Featured image from YouTube",1

69659, COVER UP: Sean Spicer Asked CIA And Top Republicans To Bury Russia Reports For Trump,"There needs to be an independent commission and special prosecutor put on this case now.Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Trump campaign officials were in contact with Russian intelligence during the election. Intelligence officials intercepted several communications between Trump s associates and Russian intelligence even as Trump was busy publicly urging Russian hackers to find Hillary Clinton s emails.Infuriated by the report, Trump s chief-of-staff Reince Priebus got caught trying to get the FBI to shut it down. Now White House mouthpiece Sean Spicer just got caught enlisting the CIA Director and top Republicans on the House and Senate Intelligence Committees to bury the reports.According to Axios,  Spicer personally picked up the phone and connected outside officials with reporters to try to discredit a New York Times article about Trump campaign aides  contact with Russia, then remained on the line for the brief conversations. The officials reached by Spicer were CIA Director Mike Pompeo and Senate Select Intelligence Committee Chair Richard Burr (R-N.C), according to a senior administration official. The reporters were from The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, the official said. Spicer provided reporters  phone numbers to House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), who offered to make the calls himself, according to the official:  He was in and out of an event. Pompeo and Burr told the journalists that the Times story wasn t true but provided no details, frustrating the competing reporters, according to the official:  Both of them said: All I can tell you is the story is not accurate. This looks like a direct effort by Trump s White House to kill a report he doesn t like, which begs the question: Why is Trump so desperate to kill the reports about his ties to Russia?Trump s repeated attempts to do so smacks of a cover-up and he is using his partisan CIA Director and top Republicans to do it, the very Republicans who lead the committees that would be responsible for investigating Trump and his Russia ties.Now it s clear that Republicans in Congress can t be trusted to run such an investigation, and former CIA and Pentagon official George Little agrees. It s doubtful that Congress can conduct an objective and independent investigation into ties between this White House and the Russian government if it is collaborating so closely on media pushback with the White House press secretary,  he said.And that means an independent commission needs to be tasked with investigating Trump s ties to Russia and a special prosecutor should be appointed to oversee it.Because it is clear that Trump and his team are trying to hide something. There is something they don t want the American people discovering. We deserve to know the truth and by trying so hard to kill it, Trump is making this story even bigger and more important than ever.Featured Image: Win McNamee/Getty Images",1
29180,"In Istanbul, 38 Killed in 2 Blasts Possibly Targeting Police Officers - The New York Times","ISTANBUL  —     people were killed and 136 were wounded here on Saturday in two explosions, and officials said one of them was a car bomb outside a stadium that targeted police officers on duty for a soccer game. Turkey’s interior minister, Suleyman Soylu, speaking from Ankara in comments carried by local media, said the second explosion appeared to be in a nearby park, and may have been a suicide bomb. The explosions set off activity around central Istanbul, with rushing ambulances, helicopters hovering, and a large plume of smoke rising over the city, scenes that were as familiar as they were frantic. Like last summer’s attempted coup and a devastating attack at Ataturk Airport in Istanbul, the bombs on Saturday came in the late evening, when this megacity’s streets, bars and restaurants were packed. Shortly after the bombings, Mr. Soylu said that 20 police officers had been wounded. Turkish media later reported that more than a dozen police officers had been killed. Updated casualty numbers were later reported by The Associated Press. Once the news ricocheted around town, revelers hurried home, glued to their mobile phones, amid the sound of sirens. Those closer to the stadium heard screams and the sounds of gunfire. “I heard a large explosion and immediately turned around and then there was a second explosion,” said Sheri Cavazos, an Istanbul resident who was at a nearby hotel. “I immediately thought it was a terrorist attack. I wasn’t surprised. I was expecting it. ” Images shared on social media showed fires, several cars destroyed and police hats scattered on the ground. But within a couple of hours it seemed clear that a major attack against civilians had not transpired. The bombings occurred after the game was over and most fans had left the area around the stadium. Local media reported that the attack targeted a riot police bus, not a gathering of civilians. Turkey faces numerous security threats, including the Islamic State, which Turkey is fighting in Syria and Iraq as part of an   coalition against the terrorist group, and Kurdish militants who are at war with the Turkish state in the southeast. No group immediately took credit for the attack, although the choice of target  —   the police, rather than civilians  —   was in line with the types of attacks that have been carried out by Kurdish militants. Over the last four years, Turkey has evolved from a country of stability and prosperity that was trying to lead the Middle East at a time of great turmoil to one that is increasingly consumed by violence and political problems within its own borders. Istanbul, a city of 14 million residents that has thrummed with tourists in recent years, has become a frequent target, with attacks over the last year in the old city and on Istiklal Avenue, the most famous street. Tourism has collapsed, businesses have fled the city center to go to the suburbs, and many trendy restaurants and shops have closed. “This is the new norm now,” said Ozan Tas, a taxi driver who was working near the stadium.",0
3342,"U.S., Canada put pipeline fight in the past with state dinner","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House is eager to turn the page on the years-long fight over a crude oil pipeline with Canada and celebrate its close economic and security ties with its northern neighbor, U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice said on Wednesday. Trade between the United States and Canada and joint efforts to curb climate change will loom large on the agenda for the meeting between President Barack Obama and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Washington on Thursday. It will be followed by a star-studded state dinner meant to recognize the importance of the bilateral relationship, the first state dinner to honor Canada in 19 years. Trudeau’s Liberals came to power in November by ousting right-wing Conservative leader Stephen Harper, whose ties with Washington deteriorated as he hectored Obama over the Keystone XL pipeline. President Barack Obama blocked the project last year, a victory for environmentalists who had campaigned against the pipeline. The spat is in the past, Rice said. “In any bilateral relationship, there are going to be issues of difference and occasional friction,” she told Reuters in an interview.  “The complexity and the breadth and the depth of the U.S-Canada relationship is such that no single issue can overshadow the totality of the relationship,” she said. Obama and Trudeau will discuss the next steps for the “Beyond the Border” initiative, a plan to speed travel and trade, Rice said. “With the longest peaceful border and $2 billion a day in trade in both directions, we have an enormous shared stake in a border that is open for business and open for travel - and safe,” Rice said. Trudeau campaigned to strengthen ties with the United States, but also promised he would pull out six fighter jets from the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Rice said the White House is satisfied with steps that Trudeau took to beef up training, surveillance and other support to the coalition. “Taken as a whole, we view the Canadian stepped-up contribution to the counter-ISIL campaign as being very, very valuable and welcome,” Rice said, using an acronym for Islamic State. The White House has also watched closely as Trudeau welcomed 25,000 Syrian refugees to Canada in four months. “We’ve seen thus far that Canada is taking very seriously its responsibility to its own citizens and to our common security to be vigilant as it welcomes these new refugees,” Rice said.

12496," Michelle Obama Wore A Nice Dress, So Conservatives Called Her ‘Ape’ And ‘Gorilla’ (SCREENSHOTS)","This may shock you, but Michelle Obama wears clothing. In fact, sometimes she wears very nice clothing, like the Naeem Khan dress she wore to the Nordic state dinner on Friday. The Washington Post reports:Michelle Obama is standing out in a sea of black tuxedos in a blush-colored, strapless, floor-length gown at the Nordic Summit dinner.The first lady chose a dress by Indian-born designer Naeem Khan for the White House dinner honoring the leaders of Sweden, Iceland, Finland, Denmark and Norway. She finished the look with gold jewelry and a wispy chignon.While state dinners typically celebrate a single head of state   and Mrs. Obama often wears a gown by a designer from the country being honored   the Nordic party was a twist on typical White House protocol.The President did, indeed, step on his wife s dress. The First Lady feigned outrage, then the couple had some fun with the situation. She looks good,  Barack said when the two paused for photographs.  He stepped on my dress,  Michelle followed up. The President then put a finger up to his lips, playfully  shushing  as though the incident was to remain a huge secret. It was a very human moment for the First Couple. Naturally, conservatives had to jump in to share their thoughts on the  apes  in the White House. You can put lipstick on a monkey, but you still have a monkey,  one commenter on ABC News  Facebook page wrote. One person wondered if  his  (Michelle s)  fake booby  popped out of the dress. Others lamented that she did not fall and harm herself, while some chose to simply call her a  pig  and a  gorilla.                     The unbridled hatred leveled at the First Family is unprecedented. Recently, upon learning that Malia Obama had gotten into Harvard, Fox News fans took time out of their busy day of huffing paint fumes and masturbating to Donald Trump s photograph to inform everyone they thought she was a  n*gger. Barack and Michelle Obama have weathered a nonstop barrage of racist comments since before the President was elected the first time, but conservatives have not been remotely content to leave it at that. They genuinely believe that black people living in the WHITE ( White  is, after all, in the name) HOUSE is a crime against nature.Barack Obama has been arguably the best President in decades, perhaps in our country s history, and will probably be the best for at least decades to come. Michelle Obama is a classy woman whose strength has enabled the President to be all that he is. Their children are impressive young ladies who will certainly make an impact on the world. The problem is that our frenemies on the Right are incapable of seeing anything more than a skin color they hate.Watch this deeply human event unfold below:Featured image via screengrab",1
68658,Police Attack and Arrest Peaceful Protesters at the Dakota Access Pipeline,"Police Attack and Arrest Peaceful Protesters at the Dakota Access Pipeline Posted on Oct 27, 2016 
Near Standing Rock, North Dakota on Oct. 22, armed police corralled and arrested more than 140 people seeking to protect themselves, their cultural heritage and the health of the planet on the site where contractors bulldozed the peoples’ ancestral burial ground to make way for the construction of an oil pipeline. 
Jihan Hafiz, a journalist for The Intercept who was among the arrested, filmed the clip above, which is among the most compelling eye-level footage of the months-long protest of the Dakota Access Oil Pipeline, which is led by members of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and reservation. 
After a morning of prayer, the protesters “were attacked by police forces who used pepper spray and beat protesters with batons,” Hafiz wrote . “Dozens of officers, backed by military trucks, police vans, machine guns, and nonlethal weapons, violently approached the group without warning.” 
As the protesters attempted to leave, the police began beating and detaining them. Several Native American women leading the march were targeted, dragged out of the crowd, and arrested. One man was body-slammed to the ground, while another woman broke her ankle running from the police. The military and police trucks followed the protesters as nearly a hundred officers corralled the protesters into a circle. Among the arrested were journalists, a 17-year-old pregnant girl, and a 78-year-old woman. 
In total, more than 140 people were detained in half an hour. It was the largest roundup of protesters since the movement against the pipelines intensified two months ago. A majority of those arrested were charged with rioting and criminal trespass. Overall, close to 300 people have been arrested since protests against the pipeline kicked off over the summer.

When we arrived in Mandan, the jail was so overwhelmed with people that we had to sit on the floor in the jail’s common area. Two Native American men were thrown into solitary confinement. A number of women faced humiliating strip searches, which included spreading their body parts and jumping up and down while coughing. We were refused phone calls and received no food or water for eight hours after being arrested. Two women fainted from low blood sugar and another had her medication taken away, causing her to shake and sweat profusely. 
When I was released from jail, my camera was missing. When I asked about its whereabouts, a police officer said, “Your camera is being held as evidence in a crime.” 
The video footage presented here was shot from the beginning of the march, during the prayer, and ends the moment I was arrested. Many families, nearly all of them Native American, can be seen running for the hills. Many people told me they felt as though they were re-enacting the massacres of the Lakota nation during the westward expansion of the United States, when families were shot in the back as they fled.",1

10034,"In Kenyan town where students were massacred, 'it's not safe'","GARISSA, Kenya — Tension and anxiety remained high Friday as the Kenyan military launched a campaign to flush out terrorists linked to the Garissa University College massacre.

The campaign came as Kenyan Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinett imposed a curfew on the borderlands with Somalia from 6:30 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. local time.

Few businesses remained open early on Friday evening before the curfew took hold. Some said the heavily armed Kenyan troops were overly zealous in rooting out Al Shabaab terrorists who have claimed responsibility for the attacks.

""It's not safe here for us as residents,"" said Abdikadir Adolwa. ""The soldiers are whipping residents to force them to identify terrorists. The military have terrorized this area and we fear going to the streets of the town.""

Many residents who could stay outside the town opted to leave while the troops were present.

""They're arresting people who have no national identity cards,"" said Nathar Abdkir Balza, a mother of five, who owns a hotel in Garissa. ""You can be arrested for loitering.""

Ethnic Somalis especially have deserted the area. Al Shabaab hails from nearby Somalia.

""The Somalis like miraa but they are now afraid to come to town and buy it,"" said Kevin Kariuki, who sells miraa, or khat, an African plant that has slightly intoxicating effects when chewed.

Earlier Friday, the Kenyan government appealed for help in capturing nine men, described as ""bloodthirsty, armed and dangerous,"" in the wake of an attack on Garissa University that left 148 people dead.

Attackers from the Somali-based terror group al-Shabab told university students before they were killed that ""this is the beginning of more attacks"" targeting schools and universities in the country, the Kenya-based Standard reported.

The four gunmen were killed Thursday as security forces moved to end the 15-hour siege, which appeared to target Christians and Islamic converts. Two security guards, one policeman and one soldier were among the dead. At least 79 people were injured, and more than 500 students held hostage were rescued.

Interior Minister Joseph Nkaissery updated the casualties figures Friday, saying the gunmen killed 148 people. He said 142 of the dead were students, three were policemen and three were soldiers. Nkaissery added that 104 people were wounded.

Survivor Claire Mumo, a student, was in the college when the terrorists attacked on Thursday.

""I was woken up by gunshot sounds inside our dormitory. The four gunmen I noticed ordered everybody to lie down before they started shooting at us,"" said Mumo. ""The blood of my friend spilled on my head when she was shot. The gunmen thought they had shot and killed me.""

The gunmen left her alone because they thought she was already dead, she said. As she lay on the floor, she heard them carry out their plans.

""I heard them asking and separating Muslims and Christians students. Then shortly I heard sounds of gunshots,"" Mumo added. ""I only came out when I saw our security forces collecting bodies. I will never forget this attack. I'm lucky to be alive.""

Survivor Helen Titus said one of the first things that the al-Shabab gunmen did when they entered the campus early Thursday was to head for a lecture hall where Christians were in prayer. Al-Shabab is a Somalia-based Islamic extremist group with ties to al-Qaida.

""They investigated our area. They knew everything,"" Titus told The Associated Press outside a hospital in Garissa where she was being treated for a bullet wound to the wrist.

Titus, a 21-year-old English literature student, said she smeared blood from classmates on her face and hair and lay still at one point in hopes the gunmen would think she was dead.

The gunmen also told students hiding in dormitories to come out, assuring them that they would not be killed, said Titus, who wore a patient's gown as she sat on a bench in the hospital yard.

""We just wondered whether to come out or not,"" she said. Many students did, whereupon the gunmen started shooting men, saying they would not kill ""ladies,"" Titus said. But they also shot women and targeted Christians, said Titus, who is a Christian.

Esther Wanjiru said she was awake at the time of the attack. Asked if she lost anyone, she said: ""My best friend.""

Another survivor, Nina Kozel, said she was awakened by screaming and that many students escaped by sprinting to the fences and jumping over them. Some suffered bruises, she said. Many men were unable to escape, and hid in vain under beds and in closets in their rooms, according to Kozel.

""They were shot there and then,"" she said.

The mortuaries in Garissa, near the Somali border in northeastern Kenya, were so overwhelmed they had to ship many of the bodies to the capital of Nairobi, 200 miles away, the BBC reported.

The government began evacuating students who survived the Thursday terror attack, but many parents still don't know about their fate of their children.

""I phoned my daughter Susan since yesterday in the morning when I received bad news about the attack, but she didn't pick my calls,"" said Eunice Wangari, a mother of three. ""I don't know if she's still alive or not. The government is taking too long to identify the bodies. I am very stressed.""

Judith Musyoka, 45, and Boaz Musyoka, 55, are still searching for their son, Sammy Mutiso Musau in the wake of the attack that killed 147 students and staff.

""I don't know if my son is still alive,"" said Boaz. ""When I heard the news about terror attack I called him several times but his phone was not going through. I need to know his fate.""

A curfew was imposed for two weeks on Garissa and three neighboring counties. Cabinet Secretary of Education Jacob Kaimenyi ordered the university closed for an unspecified period, sending many students lugging suitcases onto buses Friday.

The Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT) advised teachers in the region to leave immediately if they felt unsafe.

""We will not allow our teachers to risk their lives working in an insecure environment,"" said Willison Sosion, chairman of KNUT, who called for Garissa University to be closed permanently.

Some Kenyans were angry that the government didn't take sufficient security precautions. The attack came six days after Britain advised ""against all but essential travel"" to parts of Kenya, including Garissa.

A day before the attack, President Uhuru Kenyatta dismissed that warning as well as an Australian one pertaining to Nairobi and Mombasa, saying: ""Kenya is safe as any country in the world. The travel advisories being issued by our friends are not genuine.""

Garissa Gov. Nathif Jama Adam condemned the attack and demanded the government address security in the region to stop locals from leaving.

""I want to plead with Kenyans to stay here as we work with the government to boost security in our region,"" he said, in particular appealing to Christians in the region. ""We'll not allow terrorists to divide our people on religion lines.""

Kenyan officials offered a $220,000 bounty for Mohammed Mohamud, who they suspect planned the attack. On social media, the Interior Ministry called him ""the mastermind.""

Mohamud, who goes by other aliases, may have been assisted by two youths who conducted surveillance on the university, Kenya's The Star newspaper reported. He reportedly has claimed responsibility for a bus attack that left dozens dead late last year.

National chairperson of the National Muslim Council of Kenya, Nazlin Umar Fazaldin Rajput, criticized the government for failing to shore up security after Somali-based militants attacked civilians in retaliation for Kenyan military operations against their base in Somalia. Kenya began those operations in 2011 after a spate of kidnappings.

""All it took was four poorly armed terrorists against our entire intelligence and armed forces. This is a shame,"" she said. ""It is not the terrorist who is an enemy, the enemy is our failed security apparatus and the officers charged with those dockets.""

Rajput said the Kenyan military can do a better job guarding the borders and the people.

""Until we replace inefficient officers with efficient ones and address the root cause of our suffering, we will not win the battle against terror,"" she said. ""We have the U.N. and foreign countries giving Kenya intelligence reports, but there is no efficient execution, save to harass innocent Muslims.""

Others said Muslims, like all Kenyans, must cooperate with authorities, pointing to another terror attack near Dadaab camp for refugees — 10 miles from Garissa University — on Thursday.

Dadaab Deputy County Commissioner Albert Kimanthi said an unknown number of gunmen wearing balaclavas and armed with AK-47 rifles stormed the camp around 3 a.m. and killed a teacher. The gunmen injured four guards.

""It's our responsibility to give intelligence necessary information to curb such attacks,"" he said. ""The joint operation that involves the regular and administration police officers has been working hard to nab the criminals.""

At Garissa University, Maureen Manyego, 21, hid in a wardrobe in a women's dormitory during the attacks. She said the terrorists lectured their victims on why they were about to die.

""We are here to kill and die with you,"" the militants said, she told the Standard. ""We are not afraid of death.""

They told the students they were being killed ""to pay for the arrogance of your political leader"" who refuses to remove troops from Somalia.

""As long as Kenya's military is in Somalia, it will be paid with its citizens blood,"" the militants said, according to Manyego.",0
19577,Trump seeks tougher sanctions to prod North Korea into negotiations,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With no palatable military options, U.S. President Donald Trump may ultimately have no choice but to give diplomacy a chance to end the crisis over North Korea s nuclear and missile programs. For now, though, he is pursuing tougher economic sanctions, including an oil embargo, and opposed to making any concessions that might look like appeasement, insisting that more pressure on the regime of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is needed before it is time to talk. North Korea seems even more opposed to negotiations until it has achieved the ability to attack the continental United States with nuclear weapons.  North Korea is not interested in dialogue. ... Kim Jong Un has sent a message with this last test that he doesn t listen to anybody,  said a senior official who helps coordinate the European Union s North Korea policy. So for now, despite calls from Russia, China, and others, there is no push from the United States or North Korea for direct talks, despite an escalating crisis that threatens millions of lives after North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test last weekend.  The Trump administration says the United Nations needs to tighten economic sanctions to pressure North Korea to change its behavior and start talking. A draft sanctions resolution was circulated to the United Nations Security Council on Wednesday. Trump s tactics, one senior administration official said on the condition of anonymity, mirror those in many of his business deals: simultaneously playing good cop and bad cop, not appearing too interested in making a deal but keeping lines of communication open. Trump said on Wednesday after a call with Chinese leader Xi Jinping that military action against North Korea was not a first choice,  but we will see what happens.  Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said on Sunday that Kim was  begging for war,  but added:  The time has come for us to exhaust all of our diplomatic means before it s too late.  The United States wants the Security Council to impose an oil embargo on North Korea, ban its exports of textiles and the hiring of North Korean laborers abroad and subject leader Kim Jong Un to an asset freeze and travel ban, according to a draft resolution seen by Reuters on Wednesday. It was not immediately clear if the draft had the support of North Korean ally China, which along with Russia, while denouncing the latest test, has said that resolving the nuclear crisis is impossible with sanctions and pressure alone. [L4N1LN25F] A decade of sanctions has not slowed North Korea s nuclear weapons program, and now that it is closer to its goal, diplomats and analysts say it is unlikely to back down.  The U.S. policy of strategic patience on North Korea has assumed that time is on their side - that economic sanctions will eventually lead to the collapse of Kim Jong Un s regime and its economy, and it will come to the negotiating table, no longer able to withstand the economic pain,  said Moon Chung-in, a special adviser to South Korea s president on foreign affairs and national security.  However, such an assumption has now proven wrong. North Korea s economy has not only adapted quickly to tightening sanctions, but the country has also succeeded in advancing its nuclear weapons programs despite more than a decade of economic hardship.  Zhao Tong, a Beijing-based North Korea expert at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center, said Pyongyang may hope Washington ultimately will recognize it has developed a credible nuclear capability, abandon its long-standing precondition for talks - that North Korea accept that they be aimed at its nuclear disarmament - and instead seek the freezing its nuclear program.  From the North Korean perspective, their strategy is working,  he said.  Most experts say it no longer is realistic to think North Korea will trade away its nuclear arsenal in exchange for sanctions relief, economic support, or a peace treaty with the United States ending the formal state of war that has existed since the 1950-53 Korean War. Robert Einhorn, a former senior U.S. non-proliferation specialist now at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, said North Korea has learned from the U.S. invasion of Iraq and the late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi s decision to stop developing weapons of mass destruction  that you can t give up critical assets that you need for your own survival.  China has put forth a  freeze-for-freeze  proposal that would suspend large-scale U.S. military exercises with South Korea in return for a suspension of North Korean nuclear and missile tests. Washington continues to reject that idea. But the longer diplomacy is delayed, the greater the chances that North Korea can master the ability to hit the U.S. mainland with nuclear-tipped missiles, and then enter talks from a position of strength. South Korea is keeping open the option of dialogue with North Korea, and hopes Washington and Seoul can develop a diplomatic  roadmap,  Cho Hyun, South Korea s second Vice Foreign Minister, said at a seminar in Washington on Tuesday.  It may sound unrealistic today, but we cannot abandon it.  ",0
48383,Congressional panel calls for U.S. women's history museum,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A congressionally-appointed panel on Wednesday called for the creation of a U.S. museum of women’s history, with preferred sites on or near Washington’s National Mall. The American Museum of Women’s History would close a gap in the U.S. capital, which has museums devoted to everything from space and spies to stamps and black history, but none focused on women, its backers said. “America needs and deserves a physical national museum dedicated to showcasing the historical experiences and impact of women in this country,” said the report from the seven-member commission - all women - empaneled by Congress in 2014. Creation of the museum would call for a decade-long effort to gather support and funding and to build it. The cost for a building of 75,000 square feet (6,900 square meters) to 90,000 square feet (8,400 square meters) would be estimated at $150 million to $180 million in private funds, the report said. The commission also recommended that Congress donate land free of charge for the museum site or provide an existing building. The museum would become part of the Smithsonian Institution, the world’s biggest museum complex, overseen by a board also appointed by Congress. The federal government would assume operation and maintenance costs. The panel recommended three sites for a women’s museum on or around the National Mall, a vast area stretching two miles (3.2 km) from the U.S. Capitol west to the Lincoln Memorial and often called “America’s front lawn.” One site is on the side of the Mall opposite the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in September. The second site is the Smithsonian’s 19th-century Arts and Industries Building, also on the Mall, and the third is on the grounds of the U.S. Capitol. Congress declared the Mall closed to new building in 2003, but made an exception for the African American museum. With the Mall already crowded with monuments and museums, Washington planners are looking for ways to pay tribute to U.S. historical figures and events away from the area. ",0
