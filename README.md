## Machine Learning Operations Final Project

The proliferation of misinformation degrades public trust and negatively impacts individual and collective decision-making. The business objective of this project is to support users and digital platforms by providing an assessment of the credibility of news articles, helping to reduce the risk of spreading unreliable information.
To this end, the project focuses on the design and implementation of a system for estimating news credibility. Rather than making a strict true/false judgment, the system assigns a credibility score that reflects how reliable an article appears based on its textual characteristics.
To address the dynamic nature of news content, since language and writing styles evolve over time, the system is designed to observe changes in incoming data and to support updates when its behavior no longer reflects current information.
